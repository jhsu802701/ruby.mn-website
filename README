DEVELOPMENT SETUP PROCEDURE
1.  From this app's root directory, enter the command "bundle install".
2.  This app uses PostgreSQL.  You may need to give yourself superuser 
privileges in PostgreSQL by following the procedure in the next section 
of this README file.
3.  Set up the development database by entering the command  "createdb rubymn_dev".
4.  Set up the test database by entering the command "createdb rubymn_test".
5.  Enter the command "rake db:migrate".

GIVING YOURSELF POSTGRESQL SUPERUSER PRIVILEGES
1.  To enter Postgres mode, enter the command "sudo su postgres -c psql".
2.  Provide Postgres privileges for your username by entering the command 
"CREATE ROLE [username] SUPERUSER LOGIN;", where [username] is your username.
3.  Exit Postgres mode by entering the command "\q".

NOTES
- Running "rake db:seed" provides an admin user (username of "admin" and 
password of "password") and a VERIFIED user (username of "007" and password 
of "password").
- recaptcha removed from user validation. Optionally add this back in if invalid/spam user signups really are a problem.
- WARNING: ignoring activemailer delivery errors in production. This is because the new site is in a test mode. If merged back into the main site, will probably want to flip this back. This setting is in config/environments/production.rb.
