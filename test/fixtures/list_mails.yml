    Contra-wise, and a little tongue-in-cheek, I present the findings of Low 
    End Mac: That a 1990 Mac Classic boots and starts Microsoft Word in less 
    time than a modern IBM PC can wake from sleep!
    
    http://lowendmac.com/sable/06/0706.html
    
    Progress!
    
    Actually, I believe that modern languages are the way to go to develop 
    software. However, it does seems sometimes we're taking steps 
    backwards...Naively, you'd expect modern PCs to perform tasks faster than 
    old ones. Realistically, one would expect them to do the same tasks at the 
    same speed. But for stuff like booting, we've gone backwards!

    Typo[1] has always been a nice resource.  Not all great code but a good
    resource to see several ways of doing things.  And it has become much bigger
    than it needs to be so maybe it would be good for your testing.
    
    I found a script on pastie the other day [2] that can help you download all
    of the railsday apps.  That might be a good resource.

    They're better than they used to be.  I love my Safari account, but
    have hated their rough cuts.  I checked out the Rails Cookbook to see
    if they've improved at all.  It's not as nicely formatted as the
    Manning or Pragmatic books, but it's readable.  I'm just starting with
    it though, so I can't comment on the content yet.

    anyone who sends out buttloads of unsolicited email (which users complain
    about, or register as spam on filering services) will wind up being
    blackholed by someone. I'd hazard a guess that yahoo sb email probably
    gets blocked quite a bit, as there are probably a fair number domains it
    hosts which do this sort of thing.  they should probably take a close look
    at the aup for yahoo to see if there are any outgoing volume/rate
    restrictions.

    right.  complete bs. smtp/http don't really intersect.
    
    your customer should just invest some time in either getting managed email
    hosting from a legit provider of such services  (yahoo is an option, i
    wouldn't pick it though, their level of service is probably crap), or
    spend the energy to install their own filtering (takes about an afternoon
    in a *nix environment).
    
    If they don't have staff to maintain an email system, they should probably
    contract it out.

    Hi,
    
    I have an unusual flash project that is more programming than design  
    and might be of interest to someone on the list.
    
    The project will involve building a 3d workspace for people to drag  
    and assemble blocks of a sort to produce a form.  It's a bit like an  
    online lego construction app... there's geometry, fit (pieces should  
    connect properly) and then it will need to produce a set of  
    instructions to produce the same out of actual blocks.
    
    The client is technical in the architectural way and should be a  
    positive resource.  He's already got something similar worked out  
    using $3000 worth of CAD software, so it's not too fuzzy.  I've got a  
    sample of the output that I can make available to anyone who is  
    interested.

    Those of us at MinneBar this Saturday better be sure to plug the
    group, in our Rails presentation and otherwise. We need to show all
    the slackers that we're the future and bring them into the fold.
    VICTORY OR DEATH.

    I mean complete in the coverage sense; there is no one library (and
    currently no combination of the existing libraries) that provides complete
    coverage of all Ruby features. This makes building new implementations (and
    confirming the stability and non-regression of the original implementation)
    very difficult.

    There are at least four different test libraries that run four different
    test frameworks, producing four different sets of results and testing four
    frequently-overlapping sets of features. This duplication of effort only
    hinders the ultimate goal of all these projects: creating a complete suite
    of unit tests for all Ruby features. I believe it's time to focus our
    efforts on a major missing piece of the Ruby world: a complete,
    collaborative test suite.
    
    The other languages are laughing at us, you know...

    That much is true; I know SpamAssassin for one scores hotmail, yahoo, etc
    mail a little bit higher than other domains. However I think they're usually
    looking at From: addresses rather than source SMTP servers. If it's coming
    from Yahoo servers with a different From domain it may not be as much of an
    issue.
    
    He then goes further and says that email and web should be on the same

    That's complete nonsense. Almost all large orgs and most small ones have
    mail and web on separate servers.
    
    Anyone an expert on this type of thing?

    It is actually quite easy to override engine code. There's a  
    description on how it works on the engines wiki somewhere.  i don't  
    like it as a solution, since one can wind up with 2 files, of the  
    same name, containing slightly different code in two wildly different  
    locations.

    I saw that a while ago, and it looked interesting.  It might be good to try
    and re-write it with lots of ruby/rails example code and give it to the
    community at large.  We could write it so that it fits how SimplyRESTful and
    friends work, and make it the REST standard for working with Rails apps.
    Most likely we wouldn't have to change any of the actual spec, to maintain
    interop qualities, and we would have an actual standard for the latest
    web2.0 buzzword coding-spree technology.  Bring forth the wrath of Rails
    documentation projects, and their doomed failures.

    Here's one possibility:
    
    class NilClass
      def empty?; true; end
    end
    
    which would give you
    
    if str.empty?

    Yeah, point taken...but you're comparing apples to oranges. I've got a mac
    classic at home and it takes at least as long as my linux box to boot.
    Considering how little it's actually loading, that's not very impressive.

    Yes. But in Rails, even very common things need fancy schmancy names,

    If you're referring to the O'Reilly Rails Cookbook, then you'll
    probably be annoyed.  They've improved the look so that it's readable,
    but it's not great.  Basically, they got rid of those giant headers
    that used to eat up the page telling you that it's a beta book.
    
    It's still done as one giant stream of topics, without page breaks for
    individual sections. It makes printing one section kind-of a pain,
    because you get partial content from other sections mixed in on the
    first and last page printed.
    
    The table of contents links work, which is nice.
    
    When I digest more of the content, I'll be able to review the book itself.

    If it can wait until our get together Weds I know a bit about this  
    stuff.  My friend founded one of the largest anti-spam companies  
    (Postini), I'm an advisor to a government email vendor (GovDelivery),  
    I ran a large free email list server (ListBot w/ 35 million  
    subscribers) and I have had run-ins with the RBLs.  Too much to  
    squeeze into a message, but easy to cover in person.

    Rick Olson just mentioned this in #rubyonrails:

    Somebody was talking about openID, and I guess Senor Olson worked on a

    I remember installing minix on an old 286 box of mine (an IBM PS/2 that

    That would be cool, assuming I'm not flying out the 12th. I'm hoping to get
    to London in time for a "Pizza on Rails" meetup the evening of the 13th, but
    that means I need to get there by around 13:00CDT on the 13th. Given the
    length of the flight I'm not sure that's going to work unless I leave late
    on the 12th.
    
    If it works, I'll be there.

    I've seen PDFs for the Agile Rails book and some other Prag-Prog stuff, and
    they were very nice quality. This thread of messages has piqued my interest
    in the recipes book more. I'd heard mixed reviews so far, but was definitely
    intrigued.

    a few months ago.
    
    Anyway, it would be nice to connect with some other rubyists from my
    home state, now that I'm back living in MN, and haven't made it to any
    of the RUM meetings yet.

    Patience please :-) I setup the DNS to point to McLain's server, but he
    hasn't configured it yet, so you're seeing the default webserver there.

    I just tried http://ruby.mn and was surprised to see something there.  Looks
    like "Scratch Mount" have been there since Nov 2005.

    DATETIME: Tuesday, August 29, 7:30PM (arrive early for the regular Tuesday
    hackfest)
    
    LOCATION: Loring Park Dunn Bros
    
    TOPICS:
    
    Dan G on Simply Restful
    John Doe with a corporate Rails app demo (who are you John Doe?)
    ???
    I'll fill in any gaps with updates on the JRuby project, but I have a few
    areas I'd really like to hear more about (for my own edification):
    
    - Writing Ruby extensions (in C especially, but in other languages if
    applicable)
    - Creating a Gem from scratch
    - Creating a Rails plugin from scratch
    
    OPEN DISCUSSION
    
    I think we should also start having an open discussion topic each meeting,
    MCed by the organizer of the month and recorded for posterity by one person
    or as a group. It might make good podcast fodder (provided a good mic setup
    and appropriate equipment). This month I would propose the following:
    
    "Ruby is great, but I really wish it could do X/wouldn't do Y"
    
    VENUE
    
    I think we'll be just as well off with the current venue for at least one
    more meeting, but we need to expand into the upstairs. Is there a specific
    person at DB I should talk to about annexing that space?

    Cool, good one for the archives. Also for your reference...I started the
    RubySpec Wiki with the intention of building a community-maintained spec.
    I'm hoping it pans out once I have time to push it a little harder. In a
    week or two I expect to eat, sleep, and breath Ruby (and JRuby).
    
    Anyway, it's at www.headius.com/rubyspec. Feel free to add some content,
    even just translating (and hopefully elaborating on) ruby-doc content.

    Cool, good info.
    
    The only thing that seems slightly cryptic about the Ruby example is the use
    of $0. But frankly I think that's one of the best cases for some kind of
    'magic' variable like that, for similar reasoning to why people tend to use
    $n for regex matches: there's no confusion once you know what the vars
    represent, and it's a helluva lot simpler than messing with MatchData
    objects.. sometimes, anyway.

    I just tried http://ruby.mn and was surprised to see something there.  Looks
    like "Scratch Mount" have been there since Nov 2005.
    
    Huh?

    No, no no! There's nothing good about Rails that anyone needs to know. 
    Nope, no good reason to learn something new and compete for a job with 
    me... um, I mean those poor schmucks who have already sipped the 
    Kool-Aid. (TM) (used without permission)
    
    These aren't the skillz you're looking for. Move along.

    Here's my [Random Thought] for the day:
    
    Does ActiveRecord#to_xml strike anyone as not being quite 100% MVC?
    
    e.g. doing this feels wrong:
    
    render :xml => @model.to_xml
    
    Ok, so XML contains no presentation logic, but it's still a
    view/representation of an object IMO.  What if I don't like the XML
    format that my object comes back as?
    
    My background with Cocoon is getting the better of me and wishes for
    something like a two-step view [1] in Rails:
    
    def things
      render :xml => @model.to_xml, :use_xslt => true
    end
    
    Then we would end up looking for a "things.xslt" somewhere, maybe in
    app/views, and performing the transformation on the XML. Even better,
    something like this could be hooked into respond_to and done
    automagically for wants.xml.
    
    I then have the advantage (some would question this being an
    advantage, but I like XML) of not having to override .to_xml for every
    model I want, or change the format of.
    
    After all this, I guess it doesn't totally get rid of AR#to_xml, so
    it's still not quite MVC, so now I'm thinking about a way to perform
    two-step view with an RXML render.
    
    Thoughts?
    
    Tony

    Just kidding.  I think it's kinda silly when job posts use the word
    "ninja" or whatever to entice (repulse?) applicants.
    
    Anyway, space150 may need to beef up its web standards/javascript
    department.  Lots of work to do.  And it's a pretty cool and unique
    atmosphere.  If you know someone who is pretty into that kind of thing
    or you're interested, please email me!
    
    
    thanks

    No need for the blog-mode apology, Charles. I appreciated what you added.
    Particularly when you highlighted The Applet Problem for Java, because that
    is quite simply *the* thing that gave Java a bad rap in my mind from my
    early exposure to computers. Cursed, slow, goddamned Java applets in web
    pages.
    
    They do seem much better these days. Here is an awesome example of one, and
    just a neat project to boot: http://www.aharef.info/static/htmlgraph/

    My server/IP is in an address space owned by ValueWeb.  Sometimes, in an
    apparent over reaction, entire ISPs ranges seem to find their way into the
    RBLs, so sometimes I get "guilt by association."

    I noticed that too. Apparently some of the gmail proxy servers are in
    the spamcop listing. I reported it to gmail.com but I haven't heard
    anything about it.
    
    For my server at home, which uses spamcop, I just whitelisted the
    appropriate addresses.

    am i missing something?  i must be because i didn't see the word
    `subversion' on that page, and i wouldn't expect one to suggest a version
    control system that's even more difficult to understand to someone who's
    already having difficulty getting himself started.
    
    regarding the original poster's question, i can probably take a stab
    at whatever your problem is if you want to say what it is, as i've
    installed subversion several times by building it from source code.
    (i don't mess with binaries.)  i don't remember what i read when i last
    installed svn, but it was probably either the README that comes with the
    source or the svn book or something.

    The other way of doing this is with a rxml view where you can specify all
    presentation (using xslt) and order and what attributes to use very easily.
    There is one bug with this method though, if you use RXML templates with
    respond_to (or at any time, I think) it will use the layout for that
    controller, so you have to explicitly define the layout in your controller
    and use an except hash to not use the layout on that action, and you have to
    manually run the layout around the rhtml view for that action.  This bug was
    at once filed with trac, but it nows seems to be lost in the depths of
    downtime, but I was able to talk to a committer about it, so we may see a
    fix soon.  But yes, RXML views are what you probably want.

    I think the original approach is just fine too, and avoids possible
    hairiness down the line when you don't want nil to be exchangeable with an
    empty? in a condition.
    
    Also, if the context is appropriate, it could be useful to remember rescue
    as a statement modifier.
    
    def empty?
      size.zero? rescue true
    end

    I'll just underscore the fact that certain names do get scored differently
    by a lot of people. At my first web gig, we also did hosting and email, and
    we had problems when clients wanted to use their AOL addresses but didn't
    get any emails because.. well, yah.

    I thought I would dust off this thread as I've decided that the
    consistent irritation in my left arm is no longer welcome. Plus, I'm
    in the market for a new keyboard, so why not buy something smart?
    
    So far, we have one vote for:
    
    > > I would highly recommend a goldtouch keyboard <http://www.keyovation.com/>
    
    Can anyone recommend any other brands?
    
    Additionally, does anyone use the Dvorak keymapping? Has it helped
    anyone's RSI issues? Or is it primarily used for speed?
    
    Thanks,

    I noticed that too. Apparently some of the gmail proxy servers are in
    the spamcop listing. I reported it to gmail.com but I haven't heard
    anything about it.
    
    For my server at home, which uses spamcop, I just whitelisted the
    appropriate addresses.

    Harder to understand? I'd say they are about even. The point was that  
    there is no
    building to be done, and no huge list of huge dependencies.

    I'm helping estimate a project that would be a big CMS.  The CMS would have
    ~60 different orgs with their own templates, content, and administration.
    There would be a parent org with admin permissions over all content.  The
    CMS would have to support many languages (Chinese, etc.).
    
    Would Ruby be able to handle other languages like Chinese?  What are the
    limitations?
    
    Has anyone worked with Radiant?  Is it easily extended?  Any other Ruby
    CMSs?
    
    Has anyone worked with Drupal or Typo3?  Are they any good?
    
    
    Any experiences or advice would be appreciated.
    
    
    thanks
    Ben

    As they say, you can write cobol in any language. It seems I've written
    java in ruby:
    
            def valid_events
              valids = []
              transition_table.each do |k,v|
                event = k
                v.each do |t|
                  if t.from == current_state
                    valids << event
                  end
                end
              end
              valids
            end
    
    
    What would this look like in ruby?

    Hey folks,
    
    We've lined up an awesome potential venue for MinneDemo: Chiang Mai Thai 
    in Uptown. We'd get the back party room which has space for up to 100 
    people, wi-fi, a projector, and a full bar. Not to mention the best Thai 
    food in town. ;)
    
    The date would be September 5th, the day after Labor Day. I doubt we can 
    may *any* date work for *everyone*, but how do you all feel about this 
    option?

    Primarily for nerd bragging rights.  I've read a couple dozen large
    threads over the years on the subject (yeah, I'm totally expert man!). The
    consensus seems to be that Dvorak doesn't make a bit of difference, for
    speed or pain.  Though I'd imagine just switching up occasionally would
    alleviate some pain, since you'd be using different muscles in different
    orders than usual.
    
    I've had good luck with the MS natural elite, though I've never really had
    much pain.

    I usually get gmail via POP so I don=B9t typically check the SPAM box.  But=
    ,
    yes, Dan=B9s message landed there for me too.
    
    I wonder what caused that?  My theory is that spammers use mongolian
    addresses and the mention of our new address was enough to trip the spam
    flag.

    I've had good luck with Dan's tutorials as well. Recently, I think  
    I've been installing svn via darwinports. If you don't have  
    darwinports, you should really install it - it has matured into a  
    great package manager. When I set up Rails on a new machine, I think  
    the only things I _don't_ install via darwinports are MySQL and  
    Darwinports itself. :) (http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/)

    Sounds like a cool project.
    
    I'm not sure if Ruby would be up to it. I think you'd be constantly 
    fighting Ruby to get the multibyte languages working right. $KCODE = 'u' 
    gets you multibyte strings, but you must call "str".jlength() instead of 
    "str."length() among other incompatibilities. Not all libraries you'll try 
    to use will do this properly, and you'll have issues.
    
    The wiki has more details: 
    http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowToUseUnicodeStrings
    
    If you want to develop this with a scripting language, you might want to 
    look into Django. Python has good unicode support so I imagine Django does 
    too.
    
    Regarding the specific CMSes you mention, I have looked at or worked with 
    a couple of them.
    
    Radiant is pretty basic at this point. Try the demo, you'll see what I 
    mean. It also has a pretty user-hostile method of entering text. I 
    wouldn't trust a non-technical user with it.
    http://radiantcms.org/demo/
    
    I've worked with Drupal somewhat. It is powerful, but takes a lot of 
    module installation to get it where I'd be happy with it. It's also 
    somewhat difficult to break out of the 3 column layout, but it can be 
    done. I'm not sure about its i18n support. It does do multi-sites but 
    there is some tweaking you need to do.
    
    Jeffery Veen wrote a good article about open source CMSes that got some 
    uptake in the Drupal community so they may have fixed some of the problems 
    since I last used it.
    http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000622.html
    
    Finally, I would highly, highly recommend poking around on 
    http://www.opensourcecms.com/ They have demo systems of virtually every 
    major PHP/mysql CMS system.

    That's where I'm at as well.
    
    I'm walking through the deployment chapter in the latest rev of AWDwR  
    and the Capistrano's deploy.rb wanted a svn repository. Though I'd  
    take the opportunity to set one up.

    I disagree that Drupal won't allow for other layouts. I will agree
    that it is powerful. I've been doing some work on what your describing
    and I would be happy to share my thoughts (let's do it off-list unless
    people are really interested in what I'm going to say).
    
    I will add that there is a learning curve to the "Drupal way", but you
    get a lot of return on your investment of time. Drupal is much like a
    framework. Even if you already know the language (PHP), you need to
    learn the library and concepts. That said, I do think the community is
    really helpful in that process.
    
    Last point: i18n exists, but I know is under consideration for some
    radical changes
    
    Good luck on this,
    -Mark

    The impression I've gotten is that to_xml is handy for creating more restful
    APIs for you app, as well. You're not interested in rendering anything
    visual, just sending back some XML.

    We're not paying to rent the room, though to make it worth their while to
    close off the room and bring in extra staff they'd like to sell us, as a
    group, $500 worth of drinks and food.  
    
     
    
    Luke and I will both chip in a c-note a piece for appetizers, and we'll look
    for a few others to do the same as sponsors and see where that gets us.
    I've got feelers out to a few prospects already, so I'm not worried about

    Looking ahead a bit, make sure that you set your username and password
    on your SVN repository to be the same as the account you use on your
    server to ssh in.  It's kind-of dumb, and there are undoubtedly
    work-arounds for it, but it's one of Capistrano's default assumptions.

    I haven't touched Typo3 (yet); I'm working on migrating my blog over to 
    Mephisto.
    
    I have a few sites running Drupal, though, and I've developed modules 
    for it. It's nice to deal with, aside from the fact that it's written in 
    PHP ;) They recently released version 4.7, which is all Ajax-ified and 
    cool, and they've fixed many of the outstanding issues people have had 
    with it (theming complexity, i18n, and especially multi-site support), 
    and they're in the process of fixing some others (creating custom 
    content types).
    
    I don't know how well Drupal and PHP handle character sets other than 
    ASCII lately. PHP seems to have *very* limited Unicode support, but 
    Drupal at least has an i18n module.
    
    Much as developing in PHP annoys me, it's (a) better than doing it in 
    Perl, and (b) pretty effective given what Drupal provides.

    True, but XML can be considered a view on your data as well. Using to_xml 
    ties you to the "Rails way" of generating XML for your model (which is 
    bad, according to MVC proponents). You may need to change this (for 
    example if you needed to talk to an existing system with its own XML 
    format). So it looks like the XML builder templates are the way to do 
    this.

    FYI,
    
    Ruby Cookbook is $2 cheaper at Amazon, compared to if you used the 30%
    discount directly from O'Reilly.
    
    I also noticed a second edition of "The Ruby Way", which seems to be
    one of the grandaddies of Ruby books, is due out in November.

    (Sorry, I couldn't resist the subject line.)
    
    This is a good article on screening candidates that claim Ruby experience.  
    
    http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/03/interviewing_ruby_programmers.ht
    ml
    
    Its basic premise is that Ruby today is like CGI in the early early days of
    web programming and Java later on.  Companies don't know how to tell Rubyist
    from Nubyists are going to get burned by hiring people who claim to be
    Rubyists but aren't and, in the process, Ruby could get a bad rap.
    
    Check out these interview questions:
    
    1. Compare and contrast Ruby with your second-favorite language. 
    
    [Note: Ruby must be their favorite language, or they obviously don't know it
    very well. But just in case, a few acceptable runner-up favorites are
    Scheme, Lisp, Haskell, OCaml, Python, Io, and Lua.]
    
    2. Describe any two features you'd remove from Ruby to improve it, and
    explain what changes would be required in the lexical analyzer, bison
    parser, and interpreter in order to effect these changes.
    
    3. Describe in detail the name-resolution chain for constants (i.e., if you
    reference a Constant in your function, where does the interpreter look for
    the definition of that constant?)
    
    There's stuff in here on Meta-Programming, Meta-Classes and tree traversal
    to find methods.  In short, the article summarizes it by saying "Ruby is an
    incredibly thoughtful language, and great Ruby programmers can't help but
    think deeply about it."
    
    Kelly would do well with #1.  Charlie's got #2 and #3.  I wouldn't pass the
    muster.  I'm putting together the June meeting and so my question is: 
    
    Do we want to pay attention to some of these core things or don't we care?
    Is it enough to use the language, or should we be covering some of this
    stuff in the meetings?  
    
    I tend to like the language features stuff and learn a lot of generally
    applicable things; we've been very practical in covering real word Rails
    stuff that is narrowly applicable to Rails.  Maybe some core stuff would be
    worthwhile. 
    
    Thoughts?

    What about:
    
    def valid_events
      transition_table.select {|k,v| !v.select{|t| t.from ==
    current_state}.empty?}.keys
    end
    
    There might still be a better way, but this was the first thing that
    popped into my head.

    Dude, I just got the same one.  This is the second email like this they've

    the options that I am aware of:\n\n\
    1- put it in the /components or /vendor directory\n    Rather limited (controller/view code only, not bootstrapping  hook), only suitable for very small code.   Overriding/Customization is difficult.  I'd stay with the plugin  feature for most cases (model + utilities).  For more complex  stuff that involves controllers + views, the Engines plugin seems to be  the best option right now.\n  \n\
    2- plugins\n   Similar to /lib  but with startup hook.\n  \n\
    3- gems (similar to the /vendor option, but installed once per machine \n\
    instead of once per Rails app?)\n   Yes, with versioning and dependencies support (none of the other  options have this), but have no hook into Rails so usually requires  more setup on the user part\n  \n\
    4- generators\n   I feel this is only useful for generating simple skeleton (like the built-in ones) since code is overriden each time.  \n  \n\
    5- engines\n   Basically plugins but does allow end-user to override views/controllers.  Check out the LoginEngine.\n  \n\
    6- cut and paste into /app\n We all don't really like this :)  One level lower than generator.\n    \n  I feel these options are not mutally exclusive and abit  confusing.  Why can't I write a plugin but later package it as a  Gem to be distributed to others?  Why do I need to make the  distinction between view/controller/model code plugins?\n    \n  My $.02 :)\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\

    The "negative aspect" questions are some of the most important, I've
    found...especially in the Java world. Most n00bs just think every
    language, framework and pattern are all wine and roses, and that all
    development is some giant love-fest. You can filter them out really
    fast asking what they don't like about X and parsing the responses.
    
    The same should certainly apply to the Ruby world. It's all beautiful
    until you start digging deeper and run into the inevitable language
    and implementation quirks under the surface; until you venture into
    areas where Ruby may not yet be as strong as other platforms. Knowing
    those pitfalls are important like knowing when to jump the alligators.
    You may only get one chance to get them right later on.
    
    That said, Ruby suffers from one big lacking: no specification of any
    kind. The lack of any formal (or even informal) specification means
    that in many cases you have to run the triathlon of exploration: Try,
    Ask, and Read. First you try it...usually that tells you what you need
    to know. If you still have questions, you may ask around, on mailing
    lists or in your local Ruby clique. Still stumped, you might have to
    go to the code, either other people's Ruby code that does something
    similar or--heaven forbid--to the C code itself. If you can't figure
    it out at this point, it may be that nobody knows. The unfortunate
    thing about this is that, regardless of your opinion of languages like
    Java, C, C++, C# and so on, they all have one thing Ruby does not: a
    definitive reference guide. Pickaxe does a helluvalot, but it's not a
    spec, it's not complete, and it's not always right (so we've found).
    </rant>
    
    Yes, I think it's important to understand the core. I can tell a good
    Java dev from a bad one by whether they think
    new StringBuffer().append("a").append("b").append("c")
     is faster than
    "a" + "b" + "c"
    because the truth requires a bit more experience and a bit more
    curiousity than the average two-year tech school provides (no offense
    intended to those uproariously successful with their two-year tech
    degrees...the clothes simply do not make the man). However in the Ruby
    world those same questions might stump even a veteran, because things
    change from week to week and version to version, and with no spec in
    sight a bit more than simple curiousity is require to learn the
    truth...you've gotta be downright daring. So should we hold a lack of
    core knowledge against a prospective Ruby developer? Perhaps not as
    much as in the Java world, but it's still an effective measure of who
    knows and who does not.

    This is my quick revision:
    
    def valid_events
      valids = []
      transition_table.each_pair do |event,v|
        v.each {|t| valids << event if t.from == current_state}
      end
      valids
    end
    
    Supposedly each_pair is marginally faster.. in some context.. whatever. I
    don't see the need to name the key going into the block and then rename it
    right away, though. I'm also all about the one-line block syntax when the
    statement is terse enough. I was thinking inject() at first, but Tony's
    select() call I think is spot on. How's about this?
    
    def valid_events
      transition_table.to_a.select do |event,v|
        v.select {|t| event if t.from == current_state}
      end.flatten
    end
    
    Untested, but I think that might fly.

    One of my controllers that sends email started blowing up after I
    upgraded to 1.1.5.  Of course, I have no way to prove that it's not my
    own fault.  qmail seems to be running fine.  I can send mail manually,
    but I get an EOFError every time the controller tries to use
    ActionMailer.
    
    I figure if it was really a Rails problem, there'd be a lot of
    bitching on the Rails list.  But it's weird that it started happening
    right after I changed versions.
    
    When I get a chance, I'm going to roll back to 1.1.4 and see if I can
    recreate this problem.

    Here's a thought.  file_column does it's thing to a folder in /public, whic=
    h
    is where dispatch.cgi lives.  It seems that file_column may be running amuc=
    k
    in the /public dir and executing files (dispatch.cgi looks to be a ruby

    No solution but maybe it'll make something click for someone smarter than I=

    I am using different credentials for my repos and my user account.  I  
    believe all you have to do is to `svn info http://domain.tld/svn/ 
    trunk` or somesuch to the repos while logged into the deployment box

    Reading through Programmatic Ruby, I was surprised by this statement:
    
    "If the last parameter in a method definition is prefixed with an  
    ampersand (such as &action), Ruby looks for a code block whenever  
    that method is called."
    http://www.rubycentral.com/book/tut_containers.html
    
    The *last* parameter ... so I can only pass one block to a function?  
    Indeed, this seems to be the case:
    
         def twice(&action)
            action.call
            action.call
         end
         twice { puts "hi"}
    
    ...works as expected,* but:
    
         def mingle(&action1, &action2)
            action1.call
            action2.call
            action1.call
            action2.call
         end
         mingle { puts "hi"} { puts "mom" }
    
    ...gives me a syntax error on the def.
    
    Presumably it's this way to support the clever invocation syntax  
    which places the block at the end of a function call. So how does one  
    pass multiple block arguments to a function? Ignorant as I am of  
    Ruby, I can't even figure out how to use currying to do it ... at  
    least, not now, because I'm going to bed.
    
    Cheers,
    
    Paul
    
    * Obviously using "yield" would be quicker, but I'm making the point  
    that using one named argument works where using two does not.

    Hehe, yup, it's still alive and kickin'. Tanenbaum put out a 3rd edition 
    of the book, and with it v3 of the OS. I think he's aiming for more 
    real-world application now.
    
    I've even played around with MINIX3 myself a bit. It's not bad. 
    Definitely a *small* Unix, with no feature bloat (and some missing 
    features), but pretty good documentation.

    Unfortunately I don't think so since the empty string ("") is considered as
    a true value in a conditional.

    I found this to be helpful:

    It may be a little out of date regarding some of the Darwin Ports stuff.
    
    Also here are my subversion links:

    Mostly OS X / Rails focused articles.  Might be useful.

    The &block argument is really only an argument in that it turns a
    block provided to the method into a local variable. You can't specify
    more than one block argument, and you can't specify the block argument
    anywhere but at the end of the parameter list. You also can't specify
    multiple blocks to be passed into a method using the typical block
    form. The &block syntax just takes any block passed in and turns it
    into a Proc so it can be held in a local var and called with .call().
    
    You can, however, pass around multiple Proc instances, once you have them:
    
    x =3D Proc.new { puts "hello" }
    y =3D Proc.new { puts "goodbye" }
    def z(proc1, proc2, &block)
      proc1.call
      proc2.call
      block.call
    end
    z(x, y) { puts "yippee" }
      =3D>
    hello
    goodbye
    yippee

    I wouldn't mind a CMS dictating the presentation as long as there's a
    clear separation of concerns :)  I suppose a "pure" CMS would have no
    UI and just API/Web service calls.

    I'm looking for some good docs -- especially online docs -- for doing  
    graphics in Ruby, particularly simple stuff with fonts (drawing  
    chars, gathering metrics, etc) and PNG encoding. I haven't touched  
    the graphics APIs, and don't have even the vaguest idea where to start.
    
    I have Pickaxe waiting for me at home, thanks to Dan. Any other  
    recommendations for resources I should be looking at? The web isn't  
    helping me as much as I'd hoped.
    
    Cheers, P

    Yeah,
    Yuck.  Which version of file_column are you running?  I believe 0.3.1 is
    recent.  Hasn=B9t been updated since November (I think).  Ben, any

    Darn, there goes my idea.
    
    Looks like tmail is an email parsing library, tmailthread is the actual 
    implementation:

    This article has problems.  I am suspicious just from reading the title,
    as I am suspicious of anybody at all who ever uses the word `programmers'
    much less someone who prepends a language name in front of that word.

    This is bullshit.  Since when does software development require a
    specialisation in trivia.  And if I'm the interviewee and the interviewor
    wants trivia, that's fine, I'm sure there are 10k other people who can
    fulfill his need.
    
    I have written plenty of domain-specific languages and compilers over
    the years and `extend language X's compiler' is a pretty dumb interview
    question.  If I put C on my resume, does that mean I have to be able to
    start hacking on GCC at a moment's notice?

    Interview quizzes on language libraries are really lame.  Maybe someone
    has used a language a lot.  So what.
    
    Come on.  Who cares about languages.  Any software developer worth hiring
    can learn a language in a couple of days, especially if he has had a broad
    exposure to the whole gamut thereof.  When I see a potiential employer who
    seems to care a lot about languages, that makes me very quickly care a lot
    less about about working for him.
    
    Also, you failed to quote this choice line

    Hello all,
    
    New guy to the list and to ruby in general (~2 months).  Just thought  
    I'd drop a line and introduce myself.  My name is Michael Lewis and I  
    work for Third North Creative (http://www.thirdnorth.com) where we do  
    corporate web design, but have recently decided to focus exclusively  
    on our youth sports online product (http://www.pucksystems.com).  In  
    the last 2 months we decided to switch from using PHP as our  
    development language of choice to using Ruby within the Ruby on Rails  
    framework.  Needless to say, it's been an adventurous last few weeks  
    trying to learn ruby and pay the bills at the same time.  I was  
    hoping to find a meetup group in the area and lo and behold I found  
    the ruby.mn website after doing some "ruby rails minneapolis"  
    searches.  I do have a few questions for the group as well.  Do you  
    only get together once a month at the official meeting or do you also  
    meet informally at other times?  Also, can anyone offer any hints and  
    tricks in regards to properly deploying a rails app (ie how many fcgi  
    dispatchers, how much memory should it be consuming, etc.)?  We're  
    supposed to be launching an online registration tool that I wrote in  
    rails soon, but considering I've only launched one other rails app, a  
    demo for our new product (http://www.3n-gine.com) I'm a bit worried  
    about getting it set up properly.  Anyways, cheers and I'm looking  
    forward to meeting you all.
    
    Michael Lewis
    Developer
    Third North Creative <http://www.thirdnorth.com>

    Yeah, sure. If you can adjust your styles within the CMS interface, fine.
    But ultimately, that CMS shouldn't have anything to do with my ability to
    style its presentation, short of the limitations of the current
    technologies. At this point, we can generate flexible markup that doesn't
    dictate a certain number of columns. Allowing for a certain number of
    columns may dictate what markup needs to be generated, but the main concern
    I had was the notion of a CMS that puts its stylesheets in shackles.

    It might be that they haven't written enough of it to go into beta

    Wow - the problem was with file_column. I'm not sure exactly what is 
    wrong yet - I'll write again when I figure it out. When I remove 
    file_column from my vendor/plugins directory, the "Loaded Suite 
    /.../dispatch.cgi" message goes away.

    I took the responsibility of MC'ing the October meeting.  However, I  
    just looked at my trusty calendar and saw that it falls on  
    Halloween.  As such, I will not be able to make it until a little  
    later if at all, it being the most important of holidays for kids  
    young and old.  I have a previous commitment to escort Batman around  
    my neighborhood to take candy from (not so) strangers.
    
    So, I took some notes last night on possible topics for talks:
    
    McClain had 2 suggestions: Mercurial and/or Acts As State Machine
    Luke suggested looking into packaging a Rails app
    Hosting review
    A review of scaffolding tools (including "new" resource scaffolding(?))
    Ferret
    
    Any other ideas?  Volunteers?

    Sidney, you wrote pretty much everything I was about to on this subject :)
    Thanks for saving me the keystrokes.
    
    I saw this going around del.icio.us the past couple days, so I wonder if the
    O'Reilly article was inspired by it:
    
    http://www.javablackbelt.com/QuestionnaireDefDisplay.do?questpublicId=01548&method=before
    
    I took it and there was a *LOT* of trivia.  I also scored pretty poorly, but
    there's also a bunch of questions on there I would never ask in a job
    interview.  Who cares about crap you can just look up in an API doc?  The
    test seems worthless.

    Welcome to the group and to Ruby Michael!  I think you'll like it here.
    
    I believe there is a weekly 'hack-fest' on Tuesday evenings in addition 
    to the monthly get together.  Between that and the list you should find 
    the answers that you need.
    
    How many users are you looking at for each site/server you are deploying ?

    As I said, my experience with Drupal is limited to a previous version. 
    I've checked out demo installations since then but I haven't developed 
    sites with it.
    
    I know that you *can* develop templates that don't use three columns, but 
    you are fighting against what Drupal's default way is/has been. For 
    example, in the current version (I just checked) you can configure blocks 
    to be in the Left or Right column.
    
    My other problem with Drupal is that I think it is insanely user-hostile 
    out of the box. There's no WYSIWYG editing for content and the taxonomy 
    system for categorizing content is really complicated. I would hate to 
    explain how to use Drupal to non-technical users.
    
    This stuff is getting better, but I've been burned by Drupal before. The 
    learning curve is tough, and sometimes involves reading PHP code. If 
    you're not into reading PHP code (life's too short, IMHO), this gets old.
    
    Just my $.02.

    An article on Ruby "not being ready for the enterprise" is making the
    tech.memeorandum.com rounds:
    
    http://duckdown.blogspot.com/2006/03/more-thoughts-on-ruby-and-why-it-isnt.h
    tml
    
    Can't say I agree with the post, but I find it interesting because these are
    the kind of objections you might find trying to introduce Ruby/RoR to big
    companies.

    We have basically the same problem in December, where the last Tuesday 
    falls on the 26th.
    
    Should we have "observed" last Tuesdays in Holiday months? We could meet 
    on October 24 and December 19 instead of the real last Tuesday of the 
    month...

    Sidney, I'm right with you.
    
    Talking knowledgeably about the lexical parser and the bison analyzer is
    impressive, but I'm more impressed by someone who can talk about the sites
    they've put into production, or their ability to learn new languages
    quickly, or their urge to take on challenges they have no idea how to solve.
    
    Interviewers: don't worry about whether your candidate can answer every
    question; try to find out what they'll do when they can't.
    
    That's a better judge of a person's capacity.

    There has been a lot of talk about Rails deployment lately. The  
    preliminary consensus is that Mongrel is a better choice than FastCGI  
    - FastCGI isn't particularly stable, and Mongrel is. Apache can proxy  
    to Mongrel pretty easily.

    Luke,
    
    Thanks, I haven't looked at Drupal for a few years now and left it  
    for WordPress for the reasons you state. I've been hearing the latest  
    version is really good - but that first experience wasn't any fun at  
    all.

    I guess it depends what we're calling a view here. In the Rails sense, sure,
    but in terms of interface design, I disagree. Markup is structure, and the
    view or presentation is preferably something else altogether like CSS.

    Interesting that virtually every one of his posts was a status quo  
    argument: Ruby isn't ready for the enterprise because Ruby isn't in the  
    enterprise already. Seems to me like he should have titled his post  
    "Why Ruby hasn't taken over the enterprise world", not "Why [ruby]

    Yes, I found the RMagick documentation quite helpful for the simple line 
    drawing stuff I was doing. 
    http://www.simplesystems.org/RMagick/doc/index.html
    
    It looks like annotate is the method you want to draw text on an image.

    Welcome Michael.
    
    You should consider ditching FastCGI.  Take a look at
    http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/  It really takes the rocket science out of
    rails deployment.

    First, you can _download_  templates that have 1 column or no columns
    (there has been a lot of work to get the a good number OWSD templates
    ported). In 4.7 drupal allows for arbitrary creation of "regions." By
    default  you have the content, left, right, header and footer regions.
    But you can have a theme with any number of regions.
    
    Blocks go into regions as per admin selection. These regions can then
    be dumped any where into the output XHTML with a simple <?php print
    $region_name ?>[1]

    Yes. The "core" distribution of Drupal is pretty bare bones. If I may
    make an analogy linux::ubuntu as drupal core::contributed modules.
    Contrib modules provide the nicities that users expect, but since some
    admins might not need (e.g.) gui stuff, they are not included by
    default.
    
    Contrib modules (all nicely hosted at drupal.org) provide this sort of
    add on WYSIWYG editing. I like TinyMCE. There might be an Xinha
    engine; I'm not sure.
    
    While on the subject modules, some are good some are awful. I've
    wasted time trying modules that were never going to work for my needs.
    I find the drupal forums a good place to find out where I'm going to
    get burned before I waste that time. It's only my need for instant
    gratification that pushes me to download and test everything. :-)

    /me side steps Ruby vs. PHP minefield
    
    Reading code is not always a bad thing. Most of the good (read: widely
    applicable modules) actually have decent docs. In the cases where they
    don't, Drupal is usually conventional enough that a quick reading of
    the code gives a good idea of what the stuff does. Admittedly, you
    have to know the conventions[2] but once there you're good.
    
    Conclusion: try it, you don't have to buy it. I did some requirements
    gathering and try out testing for a similar project and selected
    Drupal. I might not recommend it for every project, but I think it
    fits this one well.

    [1] Technically, I'm just talking about the PHPTemplate layout engine.
    Drupal allows for many different theming engines, for example Smarty
    Templates or Crazy Language Foo templates. Google is your friend for
    this subject.
    
    [2] See api.drupal.org and read about the hook_* system. Understanding
    this is key to understanding how Drupal operates under the hood.

    I'm up for either Amtrak or driving. I can offer my car. It only has two 
    doors but the back is pretty roomy. Still, not exactly the ideal 4 person 
    road trip-mobile.

    I'd like to, I'm sure that's where the "action" (such as it is) will be.
    
    Oh, one other question:
    
    Does anyone want to go to Rick Bayless's Mexican restaurant, the Frontera 
    Grill? I've always wanted to go. :)

    I see these questions differently.  On the surface they seem like trivia
    questions, but in the context of an interview I don't see them as
    true/false, right/wrong answer types of questions.  If I'm interviewing a
    candidate I'm interested in how they think about the question and how they
    answer it.  If they balk completely and say, "well, I'd just look it up in
    xyz rdoc" I'd wonder whether they even have an inkling as to what I'm
    talking about.  Interviews are much different than tests.

    Maybe you should check out this article instead by the same author:
    http://tinyurl.com/8ttsv
    It has a more language-agnostic approach.  Does that jive with you any
    better?
    
    I think I understand your point about employers that hire for a specific
    programming language or skill, but I still think there's a need to be able
    to weed out candidates and figure out if a developer actually knows what
    they say they know.  I don't know how you'd find out without asking some
    questions along the lines of what's mentioned in the article.

    I just finished reading the post (and DHH's response).  Wow, that was hard
    to get through.  I can't really remark on the validity of his point (don't
    know nuttin' 'bout "enterprise"...) but how can anyone take this guy
    seriously when he can't even write an coherent sentence (from #4, my
    favorite example):
    > They are too busy thinking about the strategic intent of their own enterprises

    Huh?  I think he really hurts whatever point he is trying to make by not
    proofreading his posts.

    Hmm. RMagick looks like the right API for the task at hand! Alas, it  
    appear to use Freetype -- and I'd really like to use OS X's font  
    rendering (which is somewhat nicer, IMO, but feel free to argue with  
    me on that).
    
    I may fiddle with RubyCocoa: http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/doc/

    I have tried numerous times to switch to Dvorak, and got up to maybe
    40-50WPM at best before I needed to switch back. In my experience, Dvorak is
    without a doubt less strenuous to use, and I can absolutely see how you'd be
    able to get absurd touch-typing speed on it. At the longest, I went with a
    Dvorak keyboard for almost a month.
    
    However the Dvorak layout absolutely sucks for coding. Because most of the
    more unusual punctuation keys are not used in typical prose, they all get
    moved as far away as possible. One layout actually has the left and right
    square brackets on the same key, and the same layout for the braces.
    Semicolon is moved to the upper left corner, I believe, and there's a few
    other unfortunate changes. Beyond the punctuation moves, there's one other
    showstopper for Dvorak: keyboard shortcuts are all moved to different
    places. Without having ZXCV right where they are on a QWERTY keyboard, I'm
    pretty well lost. Some apologists will say to use Shift+Insert, Ctrl+Insert,
    etc for copying, cutting, pasting...but then I'm required to remove my hand
    from the keyboard, which defeats the whole purpose.
    
    So in short, if you want to be a blazing fast typist, writing only prose and
    rarely cutting, copying, or pasting, Dvorak truly is a much better layout.
    Otherwise, it just makes things more difficult.

    Just those same output stats, only not from dispatch... things like
    script/server,generate.. I didn't look into it as long as it worked at this
    point. I think initially I thought it was from edge rails, so if you're
    running edge where you're experiencing this, perhaps that's it. *shrug*

    So.. I'm not moving to Vancouver. Last week was a nutty week of craziness.
    At the end of it all, I ended up declining to accept the Vancouver offer so
    I could take a job out in Portland. I proposed my moving out there at the
    end of August, so maybe one more RUM meeting! ;)
    
    Anyway, besides the fact that I know you're all on pins and needles with
    regard to my life's happenings, I mention this on the chance that somebody
    in the group might be interested in going after a job in Vancouver. If so,
    mail me off list and I can help you get in touch. They're looking to hire
    three people by the end of August. It's an agency-type shop, so presumably
    all kinds of work. And it's a multi-talented group of about a dozen people,
    which has some immediate perks if you're of the right mindset.
    
    Also, I'm told Zed Shaw is moving to the Vancouver area, but I know how some
    of you feel about him and his type of.. character.. ;)

    I disagree... you could have multiple XML views of an object. For
    example, XHTML (which has a reference to CSS), WAP, RDF, SVG, JPG,
    PNG, CSV, binary, anything.  Within those different representations
    (and depending on the flexibility of the formats), you could /style/
    the data any way you want.
    
    Presentation feels like is an attribute or flavor of the view (i.e.
    style) -- changing out a CSS file to have different presentation, or
    to move elements around doesn't change the underlying structure (or
    representation, REST buzzword bingo here folks!!)  Or maybe CSS and
    "presentation" are a weaker form of view.
    
    IMO, different structure means different view.
    
    Anyway, I'm going to investigate adding another template format that
    does RXML and then performs an XSLT step afterwards ... the Rails
    internals are nuts!

    I'm going to write a point-by-point response on my blog today too. This
    guy's post is almost all sour grapes, and these sound like arguments that
    C++ developers made against Java some time before Java surpassed C++ in
    enterprise deployment. To call this guy a thought leader is to insult

    if you're bored late on a Friday and still at work, check out:
    http://www.space150.com/jobs
    
    
    Under each of the positions is a picture (I like the "organic search"
    dude), click on the pic, then the "apply" link, there's a bunch of
    questions that are meant as a joke.  Some are actually pretty funny.

    I concur with Nick...questions like this aren't necessarily looking
    for a right or wrong answer, but they're looking for a level of
    creativity or involvement that goes beyond a casual programmer (or
    someone who's just looking for a job). I've had a couple interviews
    myself where impossible questions were asked...bowling ball dropped in
    the ocean, moving a mountain...and I learned very quickly that it was
    the problem-solving process on trial--not my knowledge of fluid
    dynamics or massive-scale landscaping.
    
    That said, I wouldn't ask these kinds of questions...I'd have a
    recruiter ask them or have underlings put together an interactive quiz
    session. I also wouldn't punt a candidate based on their immediate
    responses if it was obvious they were eager to learn and honest about
    their shortcomings.
    
    For those that dislike these sorts of interviews, how would you filter
    out the Nubys?
    
    One last thing: I'm tired of that statement that "any good developer
    can learn X in Y days" nonsense. By that logic, any "good" surgeon
    could learn a new technique in five minutes, any "good" musician could
    replicate a piece of music after one listening, and so on; it's based
    on some vague definition of "good" that generally means "me." I've
    known plenty of good developers--perhaps extraordinary
    developers--that had only ever used one or a few languages. I'm sure
    there's a few things the old C guys could teach us all about
    programming, and yet many of them refuse to even look at another
    language. There's different lessons to be learned from every language,
    and picking up the syntax does not equate to knowledge of how a
    language works or why you want to use it a particular way. That only
    comes with experience, patience, and effort...and perhaps deeper
    questions about a language can help pick out folks with all three.

    Well, from what I've heard, it's a lot of work for a little money.
    Consider self-publishing, or doing something like PragProg does.  I
    love their model of doing things .. betas, PDFs, etc...

    I'm guessing that I might be the John Doe, since I mentioned at the  
    last meeting that I could demo the app I'm working on.  I'll demo our  
    new online registration app at the next meeting.  Some of its  
    features include database-driven CSS, integration with the Verisign  
    payment processor, and a robust back-end to manage all aspects of the  
    app (payment info, player search/sort/email/excel export, the  
    construction of front-end pages).  All I'll need is about 10-15  
    minutes to go over everything and answer any questions if people have  
    them.

    I think we are actually in agreement here. I see those different views of
    the data structure, and I'm with you on that. Where you feel it breaks MVC
    escapes me, I guess. Do you feel the same about rendering .rhtml?  I don't
    see much difference from that and your to_xml example. Looking at that link
    you posted, would rendering to_xml or .rxml that references and XSL
    stylesheet be acceptable? It's not all wrapped up in render, but it seems to
    fit the critieria as I understand them after a whole five minutes. ;p

    I think it's unfortunate to see evolutionary relics like this guy garner as
    much attention as you guys are giving. And that's even before the
    "point-by-point response" which, for the record, DHH already gave, and quite
    adequately.
    
    If I had a dollar for every time I read some comment along the lines of
    "swap 'foo' for 'bar' and this could have been ten years ago" I'd be...
    well, I wouldn't fucking be here.
    
    My point? This guy is utterly unremarkable, and most of the responses are
    equally tired.
    
    Why not just let him bray into the wind while you go do something
    worthwhile?
    
    For instance, why not talk about the splat operator? Today I learned that I
    can pass an array in to where a method expects a *foo argument as long as I
    splat the expression submitted to the method call! Splat splat splat!

    Verdict on RubyCocoa: very un-Ruby -- looks and smells like a literal  
    transcription of Objective C, of course! -- but might actually be a  
    reasonable way to write an app for OS X. Hmmm.
    
    Thanks to all for the pointers! I'm also fiddling with rb-gd and  
    RMagick.

    Subject: [ANN] Rails 1.1.6: Stronger fix, backports, and full disclosure
    To: ruby-talk ML <ruby-talk@ruby-lang.org>, rails-core@lists.rubyonrails.org,
    rails@lists.rubyonrails.org
    
    The cat is out of the bag, so here's the full disclosure edition of
    the current security vulnerability. With Rails 1.1.0 through 1.1.5
    (minus the short-lived 1.1.3), you can trigger the evaluation of Ruby
    code through the URL because of a bug in the routing code of Rails.
    This means that you can essentially take down a Rails process by
    starting something like /script/profiler, as the code will run for a
    long time and that process will be hung while it happens. Other URLs
    can even cause data loss.
    
    We've backported a fix to all the affected versions for those of you
    that can't update. You'll have to apply the diff for your version:
    
    * Patch for Rails 1.1.0:
    http://www.rubyonrails.org/files/aug_10_security/rel_1-1-0.diff
    * Patch for Rails 1.1.1:
    http://www.rubyonrails.org/files/aug_10_security/rel_1-1-1.diff
    * Patch for Rails 1.1.2:
    http://www.rubyonrails.org/files/aug_10_security/rel_1-1-2.diff
    * Patch for Rails 1.1.4:
    http://www.rubyonrails.org/files/aug_10_security/rel_1-1-4.diff
    * Patch for Rails 1.1.5: Upgrade to Rails 1.1.6.
    
    These patches (and 1.1.6) will break applications using the 3rd party
    engines idea. So if you can't upgrade because of dependencies to
    those, you can also add the following URL blocking while engines are
    being updated. Here's how to do it with mod_rewrite under Apache:
    
    RewriteRule
    ^(app|components|config|db|doc|lib|log|public|script|test|tmp|vendor)/
    - [F]
    
    Here's how to do it under lighttpd:
    
    url.rewrite-once = (
    "^/(app|components|config|db|doc|lib|log|public|script|test|tmp|vendor)/"
    => "index.html" )
    
    Unfortunately, the 1.1.5 update from yesterday only partly closed the
    hole (getting rid of the worst data loss trigger). After learning more
    about the extent of the problem, we've now put together a 1.1.6
    release that completely closes all elements of the hole (using the
    same technique as the backports above).
    
    So if you upgraded to 1.1.5 yesterday, you need to upgrade again. The
    approach stays the same:
    
      sudo gem install rails --include-dependencies
    
    If you're running of trunk (also known as edge) using revision 4394 or
    later, you're not affected by all this in any form.
    
    We'll follow up with more information as it becomes available.
    Needless to say, this is all the Rails core team is working on right
    now and we've recruited a whole band of testers to help us play this
    out. We'll make sure to evaluate all the feedback that's been coming
    in and develop a policy for dealing with security issues in the
    future. Thanks for your continued understanding.
    
    We've also started #rails-security on Freenet for people with IRC
    available to get and share more information.
    
    If you're floating on gems (don't have vendor/rails), then make sure
    you update RAILS_GEM_VERSION in your config/environment.rb. Otherwise
    you'll still be bound to that earlier version of Rails even as you
    install the new gems.
    
    
    We continue to update http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/ with the latest
    information as it becomes available.

    Hi Jonathan,
    
    I'm not sure, but I've encountered similar things when running some of the
    Rails scripts including server.

    I agree with this.
    
    I think it's true that a good developer can learn the syntax of a language 
    if a few days, but learning the library (in-and-out) and idioms and quirks 
    of a language can take years. Sure, you can look something up, but the 
    developers I've worked with who were intimately familiar with the ins and 
    outs of the language (and the platform -- JVM in my case) have been way 
    more productive than everyone else.
    
    At my job, we absolutely test candidate's knowledge of Java. We have a 
    pretty simple test that anyone with a modicum of knowledge should be able 
    to pass (we don't ask about JVM internals!) but a surprising number of 
    would-be Java developers _can not_ pass it.
    
    I think the author's argument that a Ruby developer should know the 
    internals of the Ruby interpreter is a little specious. But of the 
    people on this list, who can claim to know Ruby better than the JRuby 
    developers? If you could hire them for your Ruby project, wouldn't you 
    want to?

    I'm not really concerned about the money all that much. I think I could
    crank out a book's worth of content in a very short time. PragProg is one of
    the publishers we're considering working with, and they're very interested.
    We'll see what ends up being the best balance of a publisher we like, an
    authoring process we can deal with, and reasonable monetary compensation. It
    will help to talk with folks who've published before.

    Yep, we probably are :)
    
    My main complaint was asking an object for its XML representation,
    instead of "injecting" it into an RXML template and having the
    template pick out the parts it wants -- mainly because if you start
    ask an object for its representation, you might as well code all this
    extra "easy" gunk like coding to_html(), to_edit_form(), etc.

    It bothers me a lot that software discussion is dominated by writing  
    like this guy's: poorly organized, argumentative, rambling, based on  
    gut feeling with no real probing into the core issues.
    
    There is a real discussion to be had about Ruby and Rails in many  
    "enterprise-y" situations: for example, what's the state of Ruby  
    support for DB2, or XA transactions? (Will be available and solid  
    eventually, no doubt, but that's no help to a team on a deadline  
    right now!) And I think there are real and unanswered questions about  
    whether dynamic languages work as well on very large or disconnected  
    teams as they do on small teams -- static type information can serve  
    as a proxy for the close communication only a small team can achieve.
    
    On the other hand, is there a big business on earth that hasn't at  
    some point sunk waaaay too much many into what should have been a  
    small project -- and would have been small with a more lightweight  
    framework? How many millions of dollars have been wasted building  
    time trackers with entity beans? (!!)
    
    The developer community needs to start having language and tool  
    debates in terms of real design tradeoffs, instead of always making  
    it a "mine is better than yours" debate. I suppose getting people to  
    actually understand the technologies they're criticizing would be a  
    good start....
    
    Cheers, P

    I've looked at RubyCocoa as a way to use Ruby for 'compiling' to OS X  
    and Rails for 'compiling' to web.
    
    In the end, it just isn't there, and doesn't seem to be maturing very  
    quickly

    I played with meebo a while back, and it is truly very nice. I'm still
    looking for (or hoping someday to build) my ultimate IM server, though:
    
    - store all my accounts
    - stores logs of all my chats
    - always online, so services that don't support offline messaging will still
    receive messages
    - supports connecting to it from any jabber client, funneling all services
    through that one client
    - a web-based interface like meebo's when I'm away from my usual machines
    - queing of offline messages that are delivered when I connect or log in
    
    As far as I know, such a beast still does not exist. I started an SF project
    a long time ago and never had time to put into it: IMOnline

    I think the /lib directory is a good solution for small scale dependencies
    that are limited to a few files. If you get into larger dependencies like
    home grown frameworks or modules, my first instinct would be to use a more
    robust dependency management solution, such as gems. I would think it would
    also greatly depend on your distribution requirements.

    Wow, how screwy!
    
    Blocks seem so much like lambda, I would expect them to behave as  
    first-class objects which I can mingle freely in expressions.  
    Instead, they seem to occupy a very special place in the syntax.  
    What's the motivation for this nonorthogonality? Why not just remove  
    the block/proc distinction, and make functions first-class objects:
    
    x = { puts "hello" }
    y = { puts "goodbye" }
    def z(proc1, proc2, proc3)
      proc1.call
      proc2.call
      proc3.call
    end
    z(x, y) { puts "yippee" }

    I have done projects like this before (where I was not interested in  
    the money) - but the other side IS interested in the money. (I wrote  
    a game for Activision called Extreme Mountain Biking) They will apply  
    pressures to you - that eventually will annoy you. If one side is  
    interested in money - and the other is not - some interesting  
    frictions start to exist. I recommend either getting interested in  
    the money side - or don't get involved with somebody who is  
    interested in the money side.

    PragProg is one of the publishers we're considering working with, and  
    they're very interested. We'll see what ends up being the best  
    balance of a publisher we like, an authoring process we can deal

    After briefly looking at Drupal, Typo3, and Radiant, I've got a few
    observations:
    1. Don't most projects that use a CMS require modification/addition of code?
    2. If the answer to #1 is yes, is it not easier to add/modify a smaller
    codebase than a very large one?
    
    Again, my reqs:
    - 1 big org can manage 60 small orgs
    - each of the 60 orgs has a simple publishing workflow
    - handle multibyte stuff
    - custom templates for 60 orgs
    
    I think the answer to 1 and 2 is "yes".  If that's the case, I prefer
    Radiant.  Radiant seems small, and easy to add on to.  Also, it seems that
    mastering Drupal or Typo3 might take as long as making Radiant meet the
    requirements.
    
    Luke, I like your comments about the "user hostility" of the various
    systems.  But they all seem hostile to an untrained user.  Would you agree?
    If not, what are the differentiators that make one *that much less* hostile?
    
    Secondly, Luke (or Charlie, or Nick, one of you guys out there), is the lack
    of unicode support something that can be addressed in an ugly piece of code,
    and then abstracted away so I don't have to continually bump into it?
    
    Anyone looked at _why's plugin?

    To keep in the "Do It Ruby" format, I am pretty sure I could Ruby/Rails up
    this migration alot.  It seems so dirty to do it this way:
      def self.up
        add_column :statuses, :person_id, :integer
    
        # Go through all statuses and get their person ID set in one of the many
    STI induced columns and put it in
        # the new 'person_id' column
        for status in Status.find(:all)
          status.person_id = status.diagnoser_id if status.class == Diagnosed
          status.person_id = status.invoicer_id if status.class == Invoiced
          status.person_id = status.verifier_id if status.class == Paid
          status.person_id = status.closer_id if status.class == Closed
          status.person_id = status.holder_id if status.class ==
    WaitingForResponse || status.class == WaitingForPart
          status.person_id = status.opener_id if status.class == Opened
          status.save
        end
    
        remove_column :statuses, :closer_id
        remove_column :statuses, :invoicer_id
        remove_column :statuses, :verifier_id
        remove_column :statuses, :holder_id
        remove_column :statuses, :opener_id
        remove_column :statuses, :diagnoser_id
      end
    Anybody think there would be a better way to do this kind of data
    transformation without stepping into SQL?

    meebo now does both of these.  the others, I'm pretty sure it doesn't,
    though the "meebo account" is sort of like (and probably really is) a

    So i was just checking out the borges codebase (for fun) and they use a DRB
    server for holding the continuations and the CGI(s) talk to it. woo hoo.
    With some other language (JavaScript ala Rhino 1.6, Smalltalk, and certain
    Schemes) the continuations can be written to disk or stored in a clusterable
    session (or even written to a cookie or set of cookies, encrypted of
    course).  The DRB option doesn't seem too bad but you are definately limited
    by memory and if that server goes down... but, a lot of the time you can
    fake continutations with Mementos and callbacks (Object and method to call
    with the current memento on the next submit). It doesn't give the the nice
    linear feel of FlowScript (which syntactically speaking is pertty slicko)
    but it definately workable and if each "chunk" of the flow is in the same
    object wouldn't be too hard to understand...

    You'd think that would be easy, wouldn't you? Actually, within JRuby,
    there's almost no distinction between a Block and a Proc...when we
    need to make it a Proc, we just wrap our existing structure with an
    appropriate org.jruby.RubyProc instance, and we're done. I believe the
    nonorthogonality in C Ruby has a lot to do with how its blocks are
    implemented.
    
    There's some speculation in this, but as far as I know, in C Ruby, a
    block holds--along with framing, scoping, variable, etc information--a
    pointer to the "thread" that owns it. Dispatching to a block, like
    dispatching to an exception handler or calling a continuation, uses
    C's setjmp/longjmp functions. In order to know how to return to the
    original line of execution (the block's caller) the code must jmp back
    again. This explains why blocks can't be used across Ruby threads, and
    was perhaps done to allow Ruby's blocks to be lighter-weight (or
    simply to fit into the spaghetti-jmping that makes up all of C Ruby).
    When a block is turned into a Proc or a lambda, it gains the ability
    to be called directly as a function and to be used across threads, but
    it's no longer as lightweight.

    Oh, don't get me wrong...I like money. I'm just not necessarily going to
    choose a publisher based on the biggest up-front check or the best
    royalties. I'm going to choose a publisher I want to work with, that wants
    to work with me, and that is respected in the communities I hope to target.

    After briefly looking at Drupal, Typo3, and Radiant, I've got a few
    observations:
    1. Don't most projects that use a CMS require modification/addition of code?
    2. If the answer to #1 is yes, is it not easier to add/modify a smaller
    codebase than a very large one?
    
    Again, my reqs:
    - 1 big org can manage 60 small orgs
    - each of the 60 orgs has a simple publishing workflow
    - handle multibyte stuff
    - custom templates for 60 orgs
    
    I think the answer to 1 and 2 is "yes".  If that's the case, I prefer
    Radiant.  Radiant seems small, and easy to add on to.  Also, it seems that
    mastering Drupal or Typo3 might take as long as making Radiant meet the
    requirements.
    
    Luke, I like your comments about the "user hostility" of the various
    systems.  But they all seem hostile to an untrained user.  Would you agree?
    If not, what are the differentiators that make one *that much less* hostile?
    
    Secondly, Luke (or Charlie, or Nick, one of you guys out there), is the lack
    of unicode support something that can be addressed in an ugly piece of code,
    and then abstracted away so I don't have to continually bump into it?
    
    Anyone looked at _why's plugin?

    I forgot to add:
    
    RXML + XSLT basically does away with RHTML, since you can just
    transform to HTML.  But all these angle brackets and XML situps make a
    lot of people in the community do one of these:

    Actually, I thought DHH's response was, while funny, completely without
    substance. He lists some of the points McGovern made, and then goes on to
    trumpet how he's happy that Ruby doesn't meet this guy's definition of
    Enterprise. He doesn't do anything to address the few valid concerns
    (admittedly buried beneath a pile of crap).

    Ruby's continuations aren't serializable so they can only stick around in
    memory and since rails creates a new world for each request (unless you are
    running in webrick) the continuations will disappear.  i am not sure how
    they get around this in the other frameworks...

    OK, obviously disappointing, but that makes a kind of perverse sense:  
    a block isn't really a first-class function, but a chunk of code  
    compiled immediately after a function invocation that the callee can  
    jmp back to. (Viewed this way, the yield construct make a lot of sense.)
    
    It seems that Ruby actually features the word "lambda" -- and it is a  
    shortcut for Proc.new. And indeed, this works as expected:
    
         def z(proc1,proc2)
             proc1.call
             proc2.call
         end
    
         z( lambda { puts "foo" }, lambda { puts "bar" })
    
    Interesting lambda addenda from the web --

    Anyway, thanks, Charles, for cutting right to the core of this Ruby  
    dilettante's question! Very helpful.
    
    Cheers,

    Wow, that was awesome English.  In any case, before I hit "submit" too
    quickly I was planning to say that I've been using Apache 2.2 +
    mongrel cluster + sendfile on a staging server for several weeks. I'm
    very happy so far.

    I'll address the unicode thing....
    
    Unicode support in 1.8 really just sucks. There's plenty of apologists out
    there that will tell you it works fine, except except except. There's a
    myriad of libraries out there to tack on varying levels of broken unicode
    support. It's not a pretty picture.
    
    If you need real multibyte support, there's a library from Julian
    something-or-other attached to some rails bug that I believe adds multibyte
    support on top of String...meaning you'd basically need to pass multibyte
    stuff in and out of this interface to be able to work with it in Ruby.
    
    Ultimately Ruby only knows how to work with single-byte character strings,
    so think UTF-8. Anything you bring into Ruby that's multibyte will probably
    have to boil down to UTF-8. Regular expressions are *supposed* to be smart
    about UTF-8 strings, however, so this may work ok.
    
    _why posted a summary of unicode stuff to ruby-talk this past week...that
    would be a good place to get more info. You can also search the rails-core
    list for julian's patch/library for rails.

    I dealt with XSLT files a little bit at FindLaw last summer, and they
    definitely made me want to run far away after the initial fascination or
    learning a bit more.
    
    I see what you are saying more now, but I guess I thought to_xml seemed
    okay. I haven't used it yet myself, but one idea I thought of was that
    instances of your objects apps then exist on the intarwebs via URIs and
    simple XML structures. Could be usefully flexible. My understanding is that
    most implementations of this idea thus far involve a lot more
    formatting(SOAP envelopes? or am I becoming Donny to your Walter again?)
    which I hear a lot of people complain about the difficulty of working with
    at the end of the day.

    One of the big points for the "enterprise" is commercial support.  Find a
    company or companies that provide commercial RoR support, and you'll knock
    off one of the big arguments against "new" stuff in a company.

    They don't make much sense as counterparts: I think the way to use  
    RubyCocoa is to essentially go all the way OS X, with .nib files,  
    Project Builder, the whole nine yards, and not try to abstract away  
    anything -- but just using Ruby as the primary language instead of  
    Obj-C. So I'd see Ruby not as a way to "compile Ruby to OS X," but as  
    a way to bring Ruby into a dedicated OS X project. Not sure if that  
    distinction makes sense....

    Of course *I* don't fucking find it it offensive, but dickheaded behavior
    of that sort of blasts a giant goddamn hole in the credibility of poor
    shit-heels like myself.  At least that's why I was a little non-plussed by
    it.

    oh yeah one more thing I forgot to mention in that email. I don't like 
    to do interfaces because I suck at it. so I am always looking for people 
    to farm out UI work to and I think even more so now that I am going to 
    be a RoR Developer.

    I've heard on and off that there's some difference between lambda and
    Proc, but I've never quite been able to sort it out. I think it has
    something to do with how they scope variables, but it's never come up
    in most of my work. It's something to keep in mind, however.
    
    Also, Ruby 1.9/2.0 is supposed to introduce two new items:
    
    New lambda syntax:
    my_lam =3D ->{ ...block code }  # which I personally think is ugly
    
    Proc shortcut:
    proc { whatever } # which makes sense, probably just def
    Kernel.proc(&b); b; end; end

    I have been asking a lot of questions on this list in the last couple of 
    days and I thought it might only be fair to explain the system I am 
    working on and Who the hell I am even. 2 Days ago I attended the RUG 
    meeting for the first time and I introduced my self as "New" and left it 
    at that :). Well that is a pretty good definition for my Ruby or RoR 
    skills but in general I tend to be more of a ride the cutting edge type 
    of person. When I see something that will help in a project I use it no 
    matter how new it might actually be. Anyways, I am a Freelance Developer 
    who does business under the name BlackDot Ventures and have been working 
    for myself off and on for close to 15 years now. For many of those years 
    I focused on LAMP type setups and development. Last Year after a 6 month 
    unplanned and unwanted hiatus I decided it was time to go out on my own 
    full time.
    
    Late last year I was presented with a project after some time off that 
    seemed pretty interesting to me. The time frame was to be 15 days and 
    there would be a complete application at the end. Do you see the red 
    flags yet? Well don't worry that plan went out the window when I saw 
    what all they wanted. It is now March and that project is now my main 
    focus after working with the people to really understand what the hell 
    it was that they wanted. They like most clients were not to sure and 
    were looking for ideas. We looked at LAMP, and VPN X-Terminal Setup but 
    as I mentioned before they didn't like the cost of the latter so I went 
    away for about 2 months to think and they did the same. I came back with 
    the idea of why not try to work with them using a agile development 
    process. I approached them with this and they liked the idea. So being 
    the geek I am I went to the book store and got everything I could find 
    on RoR and Ruby itself spent 2 weeks cramming the info into my head and 
    now we are trying it out. Below is a list of the stories I will be 
    working on for the foreseeable future :)
    
    Project Stories ( No Particular Order here):
        Email System (Send & Receive)
        Internal Messaging System
        Project Management System
        Trouble Ticketing System
        Task Management System
        Referral System
        Administration System
        File Uploading System
        Multiple information store (Claimant, Referring Company, Billing, 
    Medical, and Employee to name just a few)
        Encryption across the entire system
        Employment Search System ( Log of places contacted, Resumes, Cover 
    Letters, etc.)
        Reporting System
        Time Tracking System
    
    So yeah this is me and this is my current project

    my_lam = ->{ ...block code }
    
    So "->" is a shortcut for "lambda"? That is a bit icky, but at least  
    it's fewer keystrokes.
    
    If you ever do find out the difference between lambda and Proc.new,  
    I'd be interested in hearing it.

    I've been doing a bit of research on this subject lately, and I've come to
    the conclusion that mongrel+pound would be a better choice than
    mongrel+apache+mod_balance as a starting point for a production system,
    with a few (admittedly common) exceptions:
    
    1. if you need some wonky apache module
    2. if you anticipate needing some wonky apache module in the future
    3. if you need to integrate with something like php (another case of
    points 1 and 2)
    
    My reasoning is that apache is quite heavy on the configuration, even for
    a basic installation, so there are far more things to go wrong (in
    particular all the mod_rewrite magic). In short, the KISS path leads to
    pound+mongrel.
    
    Also, not using capistrano is sheer insanity.

    I'd encourage learning objc, I found it quite cool, if somewhat  
    arcane. The interface builder can't be beat, and the Cocoa foundation  
    stuff is nicely documented.  There are a number of good objc primers  
    on oreilly's safari (actually, there's only one good one, the rest  
    suck). A side benefit, is that you can get all those sweet NeXT  
    programming gigs!

    More shameless self-promotion, but I know at least a few of you are
    interested in JRuby. I've been updating my blog more frequently with
    Ruby+Java musings. This represents my one and only plug on the RUM
    mailing list for my blog, http://headius.blogspot.com.
    
    Thanks for your time :)

    Subject: JRuby progress and the future=0ATo: ruby-talk@ruby-lang.org=0A=0A=
    
    Sorry for the unsolicited promotion of JRuby and my own blog, but I
    have been keeping a record of updates to JRuby along with musings on
    the future of Ruby and Java playing together at
    http://headius.blogspot.com. For those of you like me, caught between
    worlds, I will frequently provide updates on the progress of JRuby and
    the future of Ruby applications running on Java. My post today updates
    the progress of getting Rails and IRB running, with a long discussion
    of JRuby's design goals, performance woes, and promises for the
    future. Naturally, I'd like an audience, but I'd also like to dispel
    the continuing rumors that JRuby is "dead".
    
    For those of you completely uninterested in Ruby-on-Java, you can
    safely disregard this email.  :)
    
    Thank you!

    Yeah, -> is just "lambda"...I imagine the benefit is the keystroke
    thing and that it's not a method call.

    The nice thing about Apache is that (a) many of us have already mastered 
    its bizarre configuration and (b) the copious documentation for said 
    configuration.

    This is probably the key line:
    
    So, many options, some massive, but most only partial and in their infancy.
    
    FWIW, Ruby 1.9 takes a much heavier-handed approach to internationalization,
    by making String support ALL encodings, unicode or otherwise. It will
    certainly add support for full Unicode, but it's not something that's going
    to be easy to implement or available in the near future.

    Rubyists,
    
    Bruno Bornsztein has volunteered to MC the next RUM meeting.  I
    imagine he's looking for presenters.  If you have a topic you'd like
    to discuss or site to demo, please let him know.
    
    
    regards
    Ben

    Actually, this is a good place to get started.  Looking at my experience
    with Cocoon, there are several companies started by active developers, who
    provide not only commercial support, but training as well.  The RoR
    community is pretty "embryonic" still, and this is a nice little niche
    waiting to be taken advantage of.  Just be sure to be active and visible in
    the community, and things will tend to work out for the better.

    I would be happy to start with a comparison of different frameworks. Despite
    acknowledging that I sound like a Ruby/Rails fanboy a bit these days, I have
    also seen a lot of ridiculous criticism of Rails. Much of it is of a general
    style that gets slung at anything. However, I do realize like any rational
    person that Rails has gaps and room for improvement.
    
    On the other hand, that brings up another topic... the notion that
    comparisons are useless at a point because you just have to choose your
    method, accept that there are pitfalls and differences, and work with it
    all. So, I guess what I'm saying is that a discussion within us Rubyists
    alone about the merits/failings of Rails and where it could go better would
    be very good as well.
    
    Personally, I've recently begun to get some chops creating Rails plugins,
    for instance. From my perspective, they've done a wonderful job of creating
    a system for people to fill in the gaps as they see fit. Some people don't
    like the Rails attitude of, "just because you think its fit for a framework
    doesn't mean it is, end of story" approach, but I think it's a practical if
    not PC approach. DIY instead of "just add water."

    I challenge you to an apache config-off!  May the most arcane combination
    of mod_rewrite, mod_ssl, mod_dingle_dangle2 configuration win!
    
    Anyone who says they've mastered apache configuration, probably also

    Taunting aside, Luke is wrong, and should die in a fire.

    It depends what you mean by modification. Systems like Drupal and Joomla 
    have pretty rich plugin APIs that allow you to add functionality (even new 
    tables and stuff like that) to the core system. Unless you're willing to 
    take on maintance of your own fork of the CMS, I'd be reluctant to modify 
    core files of the CMS.

    To me, submission of content should be as easy to use as Blogger is: 
    WYSIWYG (no knowledge of HTML required), not exposing a whole lot of 
    irrelevant details about the implementation to the user, easy image 
    uploads. Stuff like that. Jeffrey Veen gets into the core of what makes 
    most open source CMSes suck when he writes: "Separate the administration 
    of the CMS from the editing and managing of content....Remember: 98 
    percent of your audience will be using the CMS to manage their Web sites, 
    not manage the system. Yet most systems are optimized for the other 2 
    percent."
    
    I haven't found a CMS that really meets this goal, which is why I'm 
    constantly tempted to write one. Joel Spolsky's CityDesk actually gets 
    pretty close to this, but it's a Windows-only client application. It's 
    worth checking out for an example of how easy a CMS ought to be.

    Anyhoo, say you have a method like this:\n\n\

    Now, you could easily call the method like so: kick_ass_take_names(:you,\n\

    But if you had those names already in an array, or for whatever reason it\n\

    Since you mention Ruby Quiz:  
    
    My wife got me the "Best of Ruby Quiz" book for my birthday.  
    
    I'd recommend it for learning little twists in the language and syntax
    tricks you wouldn't necessarily run across on a day to day basis. 
    
    For example, I didn't know that you can pass a code block to the constructor
    of a hash that will be called if someone tries to access a key in the hash
    that is nil, such as:
    
      keys = Hash.new do |h, k|
        print "Please provide a value for hash key #{k}:"
        h[k] = $stdin.gets.chomp
      end
    
    That kind of thing seems like it'd go well with the missing method and
    meta-programming magic.  (Alliteration is fun.)
    
    I'll bring the book to Tuesday's "Coding and Coffee."

    I actually use a custom layout, which gives my curly braces and  
    parentheses without shift. It's served me well.

    Hi David,
    
    Don't you just love that style of management?
    
    "I expect Foo."
    
    "Foo is not a reasonable expectation. We could use Bar to account for that,
    though."
    
    "We will not use Bar."
    
    "..."
    
    I'm dealing with a smaller scale, but similar situation this week. A client
    got upset, so the management made them an unreasonable promise, and while
    working 2x days to try to fulfill it anyway, I encountered a technology
    problem I'd not encountered and have thus far been unable to solve.
    
    <sarcasm>Needless to say, I'm feeling wonderful right now.</sarcasm>

    Ahh, I see now what changed, and perhaps a clue about Proc vs lambda:
    
    http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb/hiki.rb?Changes+in+Ruby+1.9#l29
    
    Basically, in 1.8, proc and lambda do the same thing, but proc !=3D
    Proc.new. A Proc uses multiple-assignment semantics for its param
    list, where lambda uses method invocation semantics. So...
    
    1.8:
    Proc.new{|a,b|}.call(1) works ok but
    proc{|a,b|}.call(1) errors out expecting two args and
    lambda{|a,b|}.call(1) does the same
    
    1.9 fixes that so proc =3D=3D Proc.new.
    proc({a,b}.call(1) OK!
    
    I imagine this is why lambdas are used for method definitions; arity
    is strictly enforced.

    Perhaps "mastered" is too strong a word. It's more like a shaman...I have 
    a series of rituals I perform to try to control forces beyond my 
    comprehension. Sometimes this causes the Apache gods to take pity on me.

    For some reason I was thinking those classes wouldn't be available outside
    the context of the status... I would change those arrays of words to regular

    Sorry, I was camping (read: getting rained on) in New Ulm on Friday.
    
    Right.  I am going and I have a room with a king and a sofabed (there goes
    the my "conference" budget for the year...) so if anyone needs to crash I'm
    in Chicago around 4PM on Thurs. 6/22.  Let me know.
    
    Pete, I was the guy Marcel mentioned.  It looks like 6 of us from the first
    BNR bootcamp will be there.  I think there was a thread on the BNR list
    right before your class.

    As for continuations maybe we need to invite a Seaside developer or someone
    that knows about Wee or Bourges.  Or <gasp> Nitro which boasts of being the
    the "premium container for wee apps"
    
    So, yeah that's a lot of name-dropping... I really know little to none about
    these.

    Of course, since Mongrel is just HTTP, could you actually front an  
    Apache, Jetty, or Tomcat instance with Pound? Would that be any  
    better? Hmmm.

    Thanks man. I was never exactly lookin' to leave Minneapolis, so I'm bummed
    on some levels, too. But I'm not exactly looking to stay settling anywhere,
    either, so.. *shrug* :)
    
    It's a long-term deal. It's with CDbaby, and Derek Sivers has been talking
    about how he'd like me to be working side by side with Jeremy Kemper, so
    that's a pretty friggin' cool opportunity, I think. Derek even made it sound
    like there'd be opportunities to form a small team to essentially run a
    sattelite company. Overall, I expect to get schooled hard, and I look
    forward (anxiously) to that.
    
    If RailsConf 07 is in Portland, then I'll be making a point to be there
    regardless. :)

    I just wish Rails would get support for Class Table Inheritance, STI is so
    messy, and I hate refactoring like this.  Well, I like it, bt I hate that I
    have to do it.  I really only did it so I have a usable class diagram :)

    Hi there!
    
    I was sent to this list by Garrick VanBuren.
    
    My name is Aaron Abramson, I run a web development/consulting/hosting 
    firm up in Duluth.  We are working on a project for a client right now, 
    part of which involves developing a web application.  My main developer 
    convinced me to go with Ruby on Rails (which I think is a very neat 
    platform, and am learning it myself now).  However, my developer just 
    quit, and the app is 90% complete.  So I'm looking for someone(s) who I 
    can contract to to help get the app to it's 1.0 stage, and be available 
    for future work extending the app and working on other projects.
    
    What we are doing is setting up a Radius server to handle authentication 
    for hundreds of hotel's and their wi-fi hotspots.  RADIUS interfaces 
    with a MySQL 5 database to grab the pins from for authentication.  The 
    Rails App is a management interface to manage hotel locations, users, 
    and pins in that database.
    
    There are 2 types of pins:
    CAM - Common Authentication Model (One pin generated per week per hotel, 
    all guests use the same pin)
    PAM - Personal Authentication Model (Every guest in the hotel gets their 
    own pin)
    
    Everything is set in the app, except for the following:
    -- Pin Batches - The ability to generate batches of 10,000+ pins for a 
    location (PAM)
    -- Scheduler - A weekly cron to generate next week's CAM pin for each 
    location.
    
    My developer wrote up documentation on what all was left, apparently 
    with regards to the pin batches, all that is left is the UI.  And he's 
    outlined the plan for using railscron to schedule the weekly pin generation.
    
    Once we get these things complete, we can deploy in a 1.0 state, and we 
    want to deploy, test, and be actively moving hotels over to this radius 
    server by July 1st.
    
    This is a paid gig, so if you are interested, email me, contact me on IM 
    (msn: aarona@utaria.net  aim: utarianet  skype: aaronabramson), or call 
    me toll free 877-688-2742 x101
    
    Thanks, and I look forward to being a part of this list :)
    ~Aaron Abramson

    I kept all the alpha the same, and only rearranged symbols and a few  
    numbers. I actually find the alpha unobjectionable -- it's constantly  
    reaching beyond the comfortable zone to hit shift that bugs me.
    
    When I'm forced to develop on a Windows machine, I'll also rearrange  
    the modifier keys so that control (the most-frequently used) is right  
    under the thumb next to the space bar, as command is on the Mac. I  
    claim that the awkward left pinky reach down to ctrl is one of the  
    most injurious parts of programming.
    
    I can send out my keyboard layout for Macs if anybody's interested.

    Sure thing. Continuations are great, and they fix the problem of the web
    being stateless. Once you understand them, you go "A-ha!" and the lightbulb
    turns on, etc.
    
    In the meantime, you can wrap your head around this:

    Thanks for all the welcomes and help everybody.
    
    I've been reading a bit about Mongrel and it looks interesting, but  
    I'm still learning the whole web server game.  I know what proxying  
    does, but to be honest, I don't know how to set it up.  Right now, we  
    have one dedicated server (running I believe Fedora 4?) that runs  
    everything we have (web server, mail server, static content, some php  
    apps, etc.).  We are also currently running Apache 1.3.x as our main  
    web server.  What are the steps I should take to set up both Mongrel  
    and apache 2.2 to work with our existing setup?

    Ooh.. these _id columns you currently have would be nil other than the
    relevant one, right?
    
    They flippin' should be if they ain't, cause this is tight:
    
    def self.up
      add_column :statuses, :person_id, :integer
    
      # old types of people
      people = %w(closer invoicer opener diagnoser holder)
    
      # Go through all statuses and get their person ID set in one of the many
    STI
      # induced columns and put it in the new 'person_id' column
      Status.find(:all).each do |status|
        people.each do |person_type|
          if old_id = status.send("#{person_type}_id")
            status.person_id = old_id
          end
        end
        status.save
      end
    
      # remove old attributes
      people.each {|person_type| remove_column :statuses, "#{person_type}_id"}

    Consider thinking of the splat operator as taking the '[]' off of an array\n\
    and leaving you with an unadorned list of items.  That's a possibly\n\
    simplified way of looking at it, but it works for me :).  Note that I\n\
    believe you can only use *splat once in a single expression:\n\n\
    a = [:bar]\n\
    b = [:baz, :quux]\n\n\
    c = [:foo, *a] # => gives you [:foo, :bar]\n\
    d = [:foo, *a, *b] # => doesn't work\n\n\n\

    I recently sent out an email to the group for a
    web-standards/javascript guru here at space150.  I'm pretty sure that
    position is FTE.
    
    Now there's a need for a full-time 6 month contract Rails developer.
    It's for the project I'm on, and think it's a pretty interesting one:
    - space150 is building it for a well-funded client
    - there are about a dozen people on the project ranging from design,
    advertising, viral marketing, logo/branding, etc.  Then of course,
    there are a couple developers.  We even have a QA person!  My point:
    aspects that don't include development are being worked on.
    - we're trying to build it the "right" way.  We do TDD for the most
    part, other agile stuff.  Both space150 and the client are on board
    with agile techniques.
    - we're planning on deploying on Mongrel
    - the project has the potential to have more users than any other
    Rails app on terra firma
    - the project does and will have a beautiful design
    - the project is a perfect fit for Rails (or as perfect a fit as a
    real-world problem gets)
    - that being said, the project will require features that Rails
    doesn't handle (it's not just a big-ass ActiveRecord app)
    - the project will face scalability hurdles that you will help prepare
    for and solve.
    - we're already impressing the client with how fast features are being
    rolled out.
    - we're downtown and onsite working at space150
    - we're having fun!  It's not a Dilbert environment.
    
    I think this is a great opportunity for someone who wants to develop
    Ruby, Rails, and deploy an app that will have to scale.
    
    Let me know if you're interested.
    
    
    thanks
    Ben

    I'd be interested. I really like the notion of mapping brackets and parens
    to not require shift. I think about that often, actually, but the concept of
    being able to do that hadn't occurred to me. I'd add underscore to that
    list, too.

    Tony,
    
     
    
    I've always had a hard time wrapping my head around where I would ever
    possibly want to use a continuation.  The mechanics I get, the practical use
    I don't.  How about you something on this at some future meeting?

    I had a great time...it was much better than the typical "sit quietly
    and do nothing" conferences I usually attend; small groups, lots of
    interaction, lots of networking. I hope it's possible to arrange
    another one this year...two a year ought to be easy to sustain.

    Step 1. Read the link that I posted earlier.
    Step 2. Read the mongrel docs and look at the diagrams to get an idea
    of how it's all pieced together.
    Step 3. Get Capistrano working.  It's pure goodness for deployments.

    no, since i don't use it, but I have noticed spammers are now embedding
    images full of text, in an anchor tag to defeat the text analysis engines.
     i guess it's time to put an html busticator back into the mail chain.

    Perhaps this will change with Ruby 2 where we will supposedly be able to
    define multiple splatted arguments at arbitrary positions in the argument
    list. I haven't come across a need for it, but it seems sensible to at least
    not require the splat at the end of the list.

    Guns are used by murderers, but many use guns for recreation. Is the latter
    group of people necessarily linked to the murderers beyond the fact that
    both groups use the same type of physical object for different purposes?
    
    People have used computers for evil worse then projecting "fuck you" onto a
    screen. Would you consider boycotting computers in light of this?

    /lib gets my vote. one could also creatively apply svn:externals too  
    (though that seems very dangerous).

    It was a grand time, and it's hard to say whether the discussion in  
    sessions or between sessions was more stimulating. Being surround by  
    so many smart and interesting people made me miss school!
    
    Agreed, I'd also like to do this every six months.

    I'm not sure we'll need any wonky apache modules, but I'd probably  
    prefer to stick to apache 2.2 just in case.  My specialty is more  
    programming, but at my current company (we're only 3 people) I'm in  
    charge of everything technology, including programming and hardware  
    issues.  Needless to say, these hardware issues give me headaches to  
    no end.  I've learned quite a bit in the last year, but I'm still not  
    even close to where I'd like to be.  Heck, I don't even know how  
    properly profile the server to see how it's handling page requests.   
    We're debating about whether to try and find someone to handle some  
    of the hardware issues, so I can concentrate more on the programming  
    side, but we haven't pulled the trigger on that one yet.  So, it  
    still leaves me having to do all this stuff.  I've heard a lot about  
    Capistrano, but again I haven't had time to actually download it,  
    install it and see how it actually works.  Is it hard to get going  
    the first time?  What benefits will it give me?  I'm just full of  
    questions these days.  I'm really glad that I finally found a place  
    to bounce them off of.

    Yeah. I keep getting these messages that start with "[ruby.mn] ..." -
    straight to the spam bin with you!
    
    Just kidding. To answer your question: no, I have not seen a lot of
    spam. But I think I do a decent job of keeping this address off public
    websites.

    So here's a fork of the other thread.  What does Enterprise really mean?
    
    To some, it's a buzzword.  When I see the word, I instantly translate it to
    mean "business," but since most computer software is written to automate
    some business process, (at least in the Enterprise :))  it doesn't really
    mean much to me.
    
    Since Java is RoR's main target, let's look at what people usually use in
    "the Enterprise" when using Java: J2EE.
    
    So what really makes up J2EE? What distinguishes it from the "rest" of Java?
    
    Let's look at the J2EE API:
    
    EJB (Remoting, O/R crap)
    JMS (Messaging)
    Mail
    All the javax.servlet.* stuff
    All the JSP junk
    Distributed transaction management
    XML parsing & transformation
    Web services (via SOAP or XMLRPC)
    
    Rails basically has most of that already.  You probably don't need
    distributed transactions, either.
    
    But once you decide to build a Java app, you have a lot of choices to make,
    such as:
    
    Should I just write plain servlets/JSP?
    What's keeping me from putting code in JSP scriptlets?
    Should I use a web framework? If so, which one?
    Struts/Webwork/Tapestry/Turbine/Cocoon/Some JSF implementation?
    Do I need an application server?  Will I get by with Jetty (~= WebRick), or
    do I need something like WebLogic?
    How do I abstract my database access? Straight JDBC? Spring? Hibernate?
    Torque? A JDO implementation?
    How do I make my code/test/deploy cycle efficient? What should I use for
    automated builds?
    What do I have to change when I go from development to production
    environments?
    
    Indeed, I am reminded of a picture that got sent around of a giant stack of
    Java books, compared to two books for building a RoR webapp (Pickaxe + Agile
    Web w/Rails).  RoR as a platform really is a one-stop shop for a lot of best
    practices.  It makes it too easy to not.
    
    Whereas with Java, there's a lot of setup involved, a lot of configuration,
    etc etc, you've heard it all before.  I guess the problem is that the people
    who claim to be "Enterprise Architects" are willing to solve any problem
    with Java, whereas a lot of time, most of the stuff J2EE offers is overkill
    or not needed.
    
    Personally, I'm willing to use the best tool for the job.  Rails makes it
    easy to solve many problems quickly.  If I needed distributed transactions,
    I would genuinely ask whether I needed them, and if so, whether Rails was
    appropriate.
    
    If there's anything "enterprisey" that RoR lacks, is commercial support.
    
    Enterprise == bureauocracy
    enterprise == getting things done

    I remap capslock to control on all my computers, PC/Mac/Unix alike, and go
    without a capslock.  Whoever designed the PS/2 keyboard and made capslock
    displace control in such a high-profile place is an idiot imho.
    
    I've always thought the Happy Hacking keyboards [1] look nice, though I
    haven't seen one in person.  And they do have control in the right place!

    Yes, in theory.  In practice, I don't think it's as simple as just "using"
    them.
    
    First off, you need to be able to "expire" continuations that are over a
    certain age, just like with sessions.
    
    Secondly, you need a way to pass a unique identifier (like a session ID)
    from the client to the server, and the server would have to look up the
    continuation by ID and invoke it.
    
    From my experience with Cocoon, there's a ContinuationsManager, and in your
    controller code you write something like
    
    sendPageAndWait(url);
    
    Which causes the server to send the client a redirect to the URL, and halt
    execution.  In your view, you automagically get a continuation ID to pass
    back to the controller.  Back on the server side, you end up doing something
    like:
    
    <map:call continuation="{request.continuation.id}"/>
    
    Which then restarts your controller code from the line you left off on.
    
    My guess is that Rails just needs some way of passing the continuation ID
    from controller to view, and a way of keeping track of them.  IIRC
    continuations in Ruby are not serializable, which may or may not cause
    problems... AFAIK continuations in Cocoon are lightweight and kept in
    memory.

    Thanks guys, offering to chip in is really generous.  In the time  
    between when I wrote the note about "feelers out for sponsors" and  
    this morning when I woke up I got commitments for the $500 we were  
    looking for.  Wow!  If this thing looks like it's going to be huge  
    and we need more for apps then I might come looking, but for now I  
    think we're good.

    That's the kind of spam I've been seeing sneaking through. Pretty clever, I
    must say.
    
    I'm sure the filters will eventually pick it up. There's a bunch of
    unrelated text in each spam, which will be worthless for learning, but
    there's the same HTML crap to trigger filters in the future.

    For some reason I feel that might not work.  Rails != Word.  Time to write a
    DB engine with cmd-Z functionality...  And real inheritance... That uses a
    straight Ruby interface so I never need to use that silly SQL stuff again.
    Maybe some Og support.  Written in LISP for easy test data creation...  And
    psychoanalysis

    Here's another example of this in use.  It's a blog post about XSS

    Hi there,
    
    I do rails consulting on the side (nights & weekends). If you're looking
    for technical expertise, drop me a line. I've been running apache on Linux
    and Freebsd for nearly a decade.  I'm currently in the middle of doing a
    deployment architecture design for a space150 customer expecting to have
    35,000 users on day 1.
    
    My customers include Space150, Utaria.net and Oracle, and I have excellent
    references.

    I had one today.  Typically I never see any.  So, yes.

    You got to be a Java developer like me :) - we seek complexity!
    
    What you want is per object format instead of a generic format provided by
    to_xml.  I think of Object.to_xml as a recommeded format (just like other Rails
    conventions) so things will be easier for me (when I use ActiveResource). 
    
    This also touches on a point, whether one should do Object.to_xml or
    Xml.convert(object).  Ruby tends to blur the line, and I prefer the readability
    of Object.to_xml . 
    
    See:
      http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.SrpInRuby
    
    By the way, Object.to_json is also there :)

    I actually offered up a Japanese-American friend of mine to Pragmatic to do
    translations of Ruby books. As far as I know that never went anywhere, but
    this book in particular was one I hoped to see brought stateside. It looks
    like the effort has just started, but I'll have to keep tabs on it as it
    expands.

    I'm not familiar with using continuations, and only vaguely the idea, but I

    So, it comes down to: If you are creating the service new and don't have any
    special requirements, use .to_xml, otherwise use RXML.

    I agree that "enterprise" has become a frustratingly ambiguous term, along
    the lines of "middleware" and "service-oriented architecture". However I
    think Rails does have a few core issues that need to be addressed. Again,
    I'm no Rails expert, so correct me if I'm wrong:
    
    - Support for legacy databases is improving, but Rails still prefers new
    apps. This will have to evolve over time; obviously building new apps is
    more fun, but every language and platform will have to interoperate within a
    heterogeneous environment at some point.
    - Rails does not really support clustering or failover in any real sense,
    and certainly not as well as multi-server Java clusters. Rails' stateless
    model does permit load balancing of a simple type, but those servers do not
    really work together or balance intra-request services.
    - While Rails does provide many analogs to Enterprise Java features, it
    mostly provides a very few simple options. The vast array of choices in the
    Java world can be confusing, but provides great flexibility.
    - DHH's reticense to respond to specific criticisms or design concerns does
    not bode well for Rails. DHH needs to take Matz's approach as "benevolent
    dictator" and be more open to external influence. To not do so will hinder
    Rails evolution and adoption.
    - Where J2EE is frequently "overkill", Rails is still in many cases
    "underkill". A platform that does not scale will not scale when the time
    comes, and there's not a body of work to say that Rails scales up to the
    largest numbers.
    - Ruby's issues continue to hold Rails back. There's no reason Rails
    couldn't be blazing fast other than the fact that Ruby is not blazing fast.
    Hopefully the upcoming Ruby 2.0 will solve that, but it's still a ways off.
    - Rails is very new, and building out larger applications will require
    multiple highly skilled or expert-level Rails developers, of which there are
    few.
    
    Don't get me wrong, I think Rails is pretty sweet; if I didn't I wouldn't be
    spending all my free time getting it running on JRuby. Rails is a vision of
    things to come in the web and enterprise development arenas, and whether
    we'll eventually use Rails or some variation of it I think it's a huge step
    in the right direction.
    
    As a brief anecdote, I present my current project. The STARS application was
    written for the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service to manage information on
    stores and corporations that accept food stamps. It was a RUP project from
    the beginning, with full and extensive requirements-gathering and design
    phases. It was developed primarily on J2EE using BEA WebLogic, with SQL
    Server and Actuate to handle database and reporting services, respectively.
    It currently encompasses perhaps a million lines of code, and has cost FNS
    in the neighborhood of $20 million, with ongoing development and support
    contracts in the millions-per-year. There are probably 150 to 200 individual
    use cases in the current version of the app, each with the usual CRUD flows.
    It's also extremely fast and extremely reliable. It handles thousands or
    tens-of-thousands of update transactions per day by hundreds of users across
    the country. Of the very few production issues we've had in its 18 live
    months, none were related to Java or the J2EE server and services.
    Continuing development has cost substantially less time and money now that
    the base J2EE servers and environments are up and going. It has become, in
    essence, boring.
    
    I don't doubt the amount of code and configuration for an equivalent Rails
    app would be drastically less. I also don't doubt that a Rails app could be
    written in less time and with similar reliability. However, Java developers
    are commonplace, Java development is well-understood and well-documented,
    and Enterprise Java as a set of services is very impressive, concerns about
    configuration bloat and the Java language itself aside. Can Rails evolve to
    provide an equivalent level of industry acceptance and enterprise services?
    I have no doubt that it will, and that process has already begun.

    it hasn't done the term "web 2.0" any better in my eyes, but i found this
    whole discussion generally very interesting. if nothing else, there's some
    nice historical and business related stuff herein:
    
    http://techcrunch.com/2006/08/08/web-20-the-24-minute-documentary/
    
    in the beginning, i was tempted to start counting how many times the word
    "bubble" was uttered.
    
    anyway, a lot of it is about the role of the web as an enabler of
    individuals, small decentralized groups, "the little guy", etc. i think this
    is defnitely true and very important in the years ahead, whether its
    accompanied by hokey marketing terms or not.

    Before doing this you will need to have some sort of version control setup.
    By default Capistrano assumes you use Subversion[1].  You can have this
    local to you development box or on a server somewhere.  There are many ways
    to do it.
    
    Once you have Subversion (or some other version control system) in place,
    Capistrano is very easy to setup.  There are several writeups out there.
    The advantages are many.  You can deploy you app to the production server
    from the command line.  If things blow up you can roll back to a known
    working version of your app with a single command.  It integrates nicely
    with FastCGI, Mongrel, or whatever app server oyu are using.  There are also
    reports of people using Capistrano to deploy PHP based apps.  Automation is
    good ;)

    Just some thoughts, in case someone really wants to present but can't think
    of a topic:
    
    - Refactoring (seems to be quite an interest on the list)
    - Testing (ZenTest, RSpec, Fixtures, etc).
    - Rails CMSes (good starting point:
    http://www.rubyonrailsblog.com/articles/2006/08/28/top-20-ruby-on-rails-content-management-systems-cms
    )
    - RubyGTK/ Ruby desktop application development
    
    Any takers?

    Well for what it's worth, I posted my response at headius.blogspot.com. I
    feel better now.
    
    The biggest smell coming from McGovern's post is that of an old-timer that
    doesn't want things to change. I can certainly appreciate the effort such a
    fellow might have put into learning the ins and outs of Enterprise Java or
    Enterprise [Whatever]...I've put in the same effort myself. However I won't
    delude myself into thinking that we've solved all problems with tool A or
    platform B. Ruby, and specifically Rails, provides a new way of looking at
    development...and it's looking pretty good to me.

    I found an interesting comparison between this 'documentary' and the  
    latest morningcoffeenotes.com (admittedly, I'm a Dave Winer fan boy).
    
    I thought the MCN was  honest, engaging, and full of interesting bits  
    on how to build a business in a smart way. The TechCrunch video  
    (aside from being locked in a browser window - don't get me started)  
    smelled like 14 CEOs well-scripted, hoping to pick up a few more  
    million in VC dollars.

    Yes and no.  The "yes" part assumes that your subversion repository is
    accessible from your webserver(s).  It's not a hard and fast
    requirement, but like Rails if you stick to convention things just
    work.  The other thing that's somewhat annoying, and that I haven't
    tried to get around yet, is that the login information for your svn
    repository has to be the same as what you use to ssh into your
    servers.  This can, and should, be a separate restricted user, but
    Capistrano is only going to ask you for one password and it assumes
    you want to use this for everything.
    
    You can skip the parts in the Capistrano doc regarding the spinner,
    reaper, and spawner if you're planning to use mongrel.  (The mongrel
    part of this is dead simple if you follow the docs.)
    
    > What benefits will it give me?
    
    When you have new code in your svn repository that's ready to be
    deployed you do the following.
    
    $ cd rails_app_directory
    $ cap deploy
    
    The end.  Your server is loaded with the latest code and the mongel
    cluster is restarted.  If something goes wrong, you can easily revert
    back.  Capistrano makes a new directory on your server for each
    deployment and then moves a symbolic link call "current" to point to
    the deployment that should be running.  There's a built-in cap command
    that will move this link back to the previous deployment.  There is
    also a shared directory that is common across all deployments.

    I'm fairly new to Ruby and this list as well.  So far, there seems to
    be no shortage of smart people here.  A very high signal-to-noise
    ratio.

    Rails CMS would be a great topic.  Maybe people could volunteer to  
    look at one CMS and report on it -- some folks here already use Typo  
    for their blogs (Nick, I think) and we'd be remiss if someone didn't  
    look at Radiant.

    My question is this: _should_ Ruby on Rails move in an enterprise \n\
    direction? It seems to me that part of the beauty of Rails is that it \n\
    leaves out the \"overkill\" features. That makes it far more productive \n\
    than the alternatives most of the time, and inappropriate for a handful \n\
    of projects. If Rails could do every last thing that J2EE could do, \n\
    would it lose its soul?\n\n\
    On your DHH point, the expansion of the core team to 12+ developers may \n\
    change this dynamic a little. It will be interesting to see where Rails \n\
    is when it hits 2.0.\n\n\n\

    That's one of the great features of Rails. Now the bullshit 2-week

    I'm looking for suggestions for an AJAX book.
    
    Specifically, I want a book that talks about when to use AJAX, not  
    how to use it (for that, I'd buy list member Nate Schutta's "Ajax  
    Foundations" book).  What I'm looking for is some guidance on when to  
    use it and when not to.  There are obvious places to use it, but I'm  
    after something more subtle.
    
    For example, I'm thinking about a cloud-tag style app that will  
    present you with a list of possible tags for an item.  These tags  
    were previously provided by other users.  The user seeing them could  
    accept them all, add some or remove some.  Without AJAX, I'd just  
    drop these into a text area.  With AJAX I can imagine something very  
    sexy:  each tag in its own input type="text" with a [-] [+] button  
    like the Apple Address Book application.  The former is probably  
    easier for more users, the later sizzles with wow factor.  New users  
    will think "gosh, cool!" whereas power users might actually find it  
    annoying.
    
    So, I don't want to pimp-my-ride too much and I'm looking for some  
    kind of guide.
    
    Any suggestions?

    I was going to comment on the use of the term "documentary" but was trying
    to avoid a certain level of cynicism I feel like I've been increasingly
    prone to lately.
    
    Like I say though, I enjoyed more than anything the historical anecdotes (I
    wasn't part of the "web 1.0 bubble") and the discussions about the general
    cultural significance of the web.
    
    I definitely prefer the cut of the morning coffee jib, though. ;)

    My guess is that if it's *really* that important, you can't track that kind
    of thing with a webapp to 100% certainty.  You'd probably have to write a
    fat client or something that would directly talk with the server. You can
    catch window.close() until the cows come home, but really there's no
    guarantee they'll have Javascript.  There was a list on the Rails userlist
    about tracking this sort of thing not that long ago.

    Hey all,
    
    Over lunch today, I had a great conversation about our local web app  
    properties/projects/etc - or lack thereof.
    
    I'm not sure if we just don't have a community building cool "web  
    2.0" stuff, or if I'm just not aware of them. I'm thinking it's the  
    later.
    
    With that in mind, I'm looking for MN-based projects to profile and  
    highlight at MNteractive.com  (a la TechCrunch.com).
    
    The two that come to mind immediately are FlySpy.com and  
    FeedMarker.com. What else we got?

    A while back I did have apache2 and subversion installed and I was  
    able to browse a repository, although it was short lived as we were  
    right in the middle of a project and again, lacking the all precious  
    commodity of time, I wasn't able to fully integrate subversion into  
    my work flow.  I know that it has to happen now as I'm running into  
    issues with our designer wanteing to get access to do some style  
    work, but my app resides on my local machine making it essentially  
    impossible.  I'll see if I can get that running again, although I  
    think I used apache 2.0.x for it, so I'll try to upgrade that to  
    apache 2.2.x in the meantime.  What's a good way to actually use  
    subversion?  Do you recommend checking out a local copy every morning  
    and committing it at night, or something more than that?

    I might be willing to talk about the different CMSes in Rails (and why
    most of them still miss the mark), depends on how crazy work ends up
    being these next few weeks.

    I'm not sure there *isn't* a book on that, but I would define your 
    audience (techies with the latest firefox? or grandmas with Netscape 4?) 
    and then use your intuition along with a good dose of casual "hallway" 
    usability testing. Like Jakob Nielsen said, testing with 5 users will find 
    the vast majority of your problems.

    Yes.. just got to 47:00.. that's pretty much exactly how I feel about this
    fervor over "social networking" and this supposed new echelon of the web.
    Thanks for the head's up, Garrick. :)

    I'd give the MindTouch people a call. Their stuff is pretty cool.
    
    Onion Networks is a local startup but they're not really "web 2.0".

    Well, this blog post:
    http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/08/30/guide-things-you-shouldnt-be-doing-in-railshas
    started a few flame wars, but the general consensus about it was that
    we
    need a central place to list deprecations, and a tool to find them in our
    code.  And now we have the tool:

    I'm not sure you need AJAX for this at all, unless you want the list of tags
    updated in the database anytime they add or remove one. If not, I'd just use
    some JS for the interface effects and update the record with a 'regular'
    post. Removed inputs could have their disabled property set to true, or you
    could just remove them from the DOM completely.

    BTW -- thanks for the reference to this. I tried it out and it does 95% 
    of what I was looking for.
    
        http://dev.roadsigngames.com/trac/rsm/wiki/VisualModel
    
    I wish it represented non-DB backed attributes as well, but like I said 
    it's most of what I needed.
    
    NOTE: it requires graphviz to be installed. I got it via fink but there 
    is some funkiness with fonts that I haven't completely gotten around 
    with graphviz.

    I know what you mean but for some reason the goal in this case is time 
    spent on the site :(. These people have to sign contracts that say they 
    will be logged into the site for nHours a day not matter how interesting 
    it is or not. I am sure I will be getting a request soon for developing 
    training modules and such to make it more fair to the users. I agree 
    with you 100% with what you have said and I have tried to explain it to 
    them on about 100+ occasions now but they shut me down each time.
    
    These people who will be using the system are not tech savvy so they 
    don't script like we do.

    I'll have one or two for you by the end of summer.
    
    On a related note, I'd like to know what else is going on around  
    town. What does MNteractive do, and how often? Are there other groups  
    around town discussing agile development, startups, usability, ajax,  
    etc.?
    
    Is there a centralized list of tech-related events in Minnesota?

    I would definitely say it's NOT a convention to have access to your
    mission-critical tightly-controlled source repository from a publicly
    accessible web server. That seems like a laziness on the part of Capistrano
    [developers]...perhaps it was just easier than building tools to checkout
    locally and transfer the files. I would never, ever want my source
    repository or any other development server to be accessible in any way from
    public web servers. A requirement like that would be a showstopper for my
    current and most of my past employers.

    Hi Dan, that sounds great. I think a lot of people are looking for a decent
    CMS they can either use out of the box or improve upon.
    Can I put you down to present on that for next month?

    I guess I should ask this differently... I'm looking for a book to  
    help me think through web2.0 user interaction.  There is something  
    fundamentally different from Hotmail circa '97 and GMail today.  Both  
    accomplish the same general thing, but the user experience is  
    dramatically different.  I'm thinking of something along the lines of  
    "Design of Everyday Things."  User interaction has lots of psychology  
    and physiology and the like and I'm not satisfied with my opinion  
    alone being the driving factor.  Hell, look at the whole 37 signals  
    approach to things.  There's thoughts to be thunk here and, much like  
    RUM helps me think through Ruby, I'm looking for materials to help me  
    think this through.

    I have used HHKBs for over seven years, and they are good keyboards.
    I think I wore out my first one, which was the first PC/Mac/Sun model.
    
    In addition to not having to fiddle with mappings, the current USB ones,
    Lite 2 or whatever, have a pretty good action to them.  Oh and don't
    forget that backspace, escape, and tilde are all in the right place, too,
    on these keyboards.  I also like having my mouse closer to the keyboard;
    all those extra crap keys on the side, while they are very occasionally
    useful, are just in the way 99% of the time.
    
    Windows users might find the missing extra keys too much of a pain, I
    don't know.  I almost never use them in UNIX, as ctrl-p and ctrl-n work
    wonders and are easier to type.  Also, when I got a Mac a couple years
    ago, I never understood why splat-` was used to switch between windows
    within an application until I was staring at my girlfriend's PowerBook
    one day and became enlightened.

    As with any other source control, it depends on your working
    environment and how horrifying it would be if your laptop with the
    lone version of your day's changes suddenly exploded.

    This blog entry is a perfect example of good content presented  
    badly.  I've been using edge for my play projects and saw the  
    warnings and cleaned my own house.  When 1.2 comes out I think people  
    will get a better sense for where they're using deprecated code and  
    fix things on their own.  This blog post just looks angry; it has a  
    very "blame the users" tone to it, which is interesting because.  
    let's face it, most people will never know something's deprecated.

    Has anybody tried to install graphviz via port on a Mac?
    
    I tried - it fails - I find it hard to resolve these.
    
    I prefer port - well not really - but I don't want to use fink and  
    port -- as I have done that before and seemed as if I would get the  
    same thing installed 2 different ways which turned out to be a hassle.
    
    Just wondering - do other people get this - or is this my machine?

    I wish it represented non-DB backed attributes as well, but like I  
    said it's most of what I needed.
    
    NOTE: it requires graphviz to be installed. I got it via fink but  
    there is some funkiness with fonts that I haven't completely gotten  
    around with graphviz.

    This has started appearing at the bottom of every page in one of my 
    Rails apps:
    
    "Loaded suite /home/imar/web/public/dispatch.cgi Started Finished in 
    0.000318 seconds. 0 tests, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors"
    
    How did dispatch.cgi become a rake test?

    Hey all,
    
     
    
    Over lunch today, I had a great conversation about our local web app
    properties/projects/etc - or lack thereof.
    
     
    
    I'm not sure if we just don't have a community building cool "web 2.0"
    stuff, or if I'm just not aware of them. I'm thinking it's the later.
    
     
    
    With that in mind, I'm looking for MN-based projects to profile and
    highlight at MNteractive.com (a la TechCrunch.com). 
    
     
    
    The two that come to mind immediately are FlySpy.com and FeedMarker.com.
    What else we got?

    the general workflow for a centralized sccm system is for each user to
    check out their own working copy to make their modifications. Once the
    modifications are tested, the user checks in his changes. the next time
    other users update or checkout, they will receive the modifications the
    first user made.  It basically boils down to being a convenient and safe
    way to move changes between people (and systems).

    This is something Java does well, I think. You can deprecate elements with 
    the @deprecated JavaDoc tag and get compile warnings when you try to use 
    that. In Rails, you have to pay attention to the changelogs and random 
    blog posts...
    
    But, Sun's approach has a downside too: they've never removed a deprecated 
    API so the cruft tends to build up over time.

    Hmmm...well, this stuff is so new that I still think that trying a couple 
    different appoaches and testing them will give you great benefits. But I 
    see what you're getting at, sort of patterns for AJAX UIs.
    
    I looked around a little, and I found this wiki/book: 
    http://ajaxpatterns.org/
    http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ajaxdp/
    
    I'm not sure if it's good but I'd love to read it and find out.
    
    This list of places to use Ajax sounds pretty right on to me:
    http://swik.net/Ajax/Places+To+Use+Ajax
    
    Finally, I'd take a look at what the AJAX innovators are doing. Robot 
    Co-op, 37 Signals, Google, Amazon, Flickr. There are amazing things like 
    Google Maps, but mostly it's niceities like modeless editing (flickr, 
    basecamp) or rating (Amazon). Changing small bits of data without a page 
    refresh seems pretty right-on to me. I think stuff like drag-and-drop is 
    harder to get right because it's so fundamentally different than what web 
    users are used to. But I think it's just a matter of time before that 
    stuff gets more standardized.

    Try darwinports (I like it _much_ better than fink).
    
    Your build is failing b/c of an apparently incompatible shared  
    library (libsm presumably).

    This gets into something that I've wanted to start for a while -- sort of 
    a hub for Twin Cities/Minnesota geeks. Not really a "community" site per 
    se, but a database of Minnesota tech companies, an events calendar, a blog 
    aggregator. Would anyone be interested in collaborating with me on 
    something like that?
    
    BTW, I've been checking into the other scripting language users groups in 
    the TC area to try to find people to pimp rails.mn to. Looks like the Ruby 
    group is one of the most active! Only a handful of people attend the Perl 
    and PHP groups. I don't even think there is an active Python group.

    Michael, look into using svnserve. It's a standalone server that comes 
    with Subversion which is much easier to set up than trying to get all the 
    Apache 2 stuff working. The only downside is that your repository is not 
    web-accessable...not really a big deal in my opinion.
    
    Using source control is likely to increase your productivity by a fair 
    amount, so it is worth the time to set up.

    If you're talking about the need for cmd | cntl + zxcv for
    cut/copy/past/etc, Apple has a novel solution for one of their Dvorak
    layouts: pressing the command key turns the keyboard back to QWERTY.
    Neat.

    The sad thing is it is user hostile and that is one of the ethical 
    issues that I had and still am dealing with. I am working with Lawyers, 
    Insurance Companies, and others who would like to be able to see if a 
    person who is going through vocational rehab rehab is fulfilling there 
    end of the bargain so they can keep getting their checks. basically the 
    system is trying to catch fraud attempts and other criminal activities. 
    Now does it sound big brother like :).
    
    The user in this case has windows of 30 minutes to do things outside of 
    this window before it logs them out and kills the session.

    MNteractive has monthly Saturday coffees and less frequent happy hours.
    
    All the other local events that are interesting to me I post within  
    MNteractive's Calendar.
    
    http://mnteractive.com/archive/category/calendar/
    
    If you've got something that can read ics files: http:// 
    mnteractive.com/wp-ical.php
    
    There's also the UPA-MN (http://upamn.org ) - and I say this from  
    experience - they're not as much fun as us. :)

    Yeah.  I don't like it either, but it's part of dealing with
    Capistrano out of the box.  This topic comes up on the Rails list
    occasionally, and there are apparently some alternatives.
    
    To me, it makes a lot more sense to have the local Cap process pull
    the code it needs and then push this via sftp to the production box.
    But Cap wants to pull directly to the various servers, which is where
    this restriction comes from.

    Tom,
    
    Thanks for the link, but: that was *another* Dan.  I'm opposed to it,  
    but somehow we have at least one other Dan on the list, and it was  
    him volunteering.

    > Criticism is great.
    
    Agreed. I guess implicit in my email was a "and how do we make these things
    better" comment.
    
    > Can you give a concrete example?
    
    Sure, I've got two HABTM relationships in on model.   One has attributes and
    the other doesn't:
    
    class Policy < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_and_belongs_to_many :asset_groups # no attributes
      has_and_belongs_to_many :rules # has attributes
    end
    
    I use the standard form helpers to handle the columns in the policies table,
    so I'll leave those out.  
    
    To take the user's input for policy.asset_groups and policy.rules I have to
    use _tag style helpers.  The simpler example of the two is the one without
    attributes:
    
    I want to let the user select zero or more asset groups for this policy from
    a <DEFANGED_select>, like so (I'll try and reformat to fit into 80 chars):
    
     
      select_tag(:all_asset_groups,
                 options_for_select(@all_asset_groups.inject(Array.new) 
                      {|all, one| all << [one.name, one.id]}), 
                 {:multiple => true, :size => 10) 
    
    
    Then, when the form is submitted I have to iterate through the entries and
    manually inject them into the Policy object like so:
    
    params[:asset_groups].each 
      { |id| @policy.asset_groups << AssetGroup.find(id) }
    
    For the Policy.rules (the one with attributes), it's even more complicated
    because you have to first save the policy without the attributes and then
    use push_with_attributes on the saved policy.  If you push-with-attributes
    on the unsaved policy and then save the policy the Rules don't get saved.

    At least there isn't another rails coder named Dan Grigsby. The other
    Dan Weinand worked on shopify with Tobi.
    
    That's a good link though. And put me down for it. I'll let you know
    early next week if things change and I can't do it.

    Linked off a link...interesting since I was looking for how to do this exact
    thing.
    
    http://www.rubyinside.com/how-to-create-a-ruby-extension-in-c-in-under-5-minutes-100.html
    
    And also Ryan Davis's "improved" version using RubyInline. FWIW, we plan to
    mod RubyInline to work with JRuby too, so you can inline Java code if you
    want.

    John,
    I just installed using darwinports (same as you) but did not get the error.
    Worked fine.  Looks like you have done "port sync" and perhaps "port
    selfupdate" so I'm not sure what the issue is.  My machine is OS X 10.4.7
    (Intel).

    Presentation/multiformat publication. Ok, we have RHTML and RXML or
    whatever.  I was an committer on the Apache Cocoon project, and IMO it has
    Rails licked WRT presentation/publication.
    
    Rails could use a decent two-step view implementation:
    http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/twoStepView.html
    
    But as soon as XML/XSLT is suggested it would be shot down by the Rails
    community.
    
    Routing also kind of stinks compared to Cocoon's sitemap.  With a small bit
    of XML (yeah, yeah), you can create a huge virtual directory structure.
    It's very powerful, but I'll spare the list the details unless someone's
    really interested.
    
    Oh, and Rails controllers need continuations, too.

    I would.  That's why I sponsored MinneBar.  I want things to be more
    interesting here or, for that matter, to know what's going on.
    
    How about a Wiki?  Low overhead.  I could host it on my box if necessary.

    This gets into something that I've wanted to start for a while -- sort of 
    a hub for Twin Cities/Minnesota geeks. Not really a "community" site per 
    se, but a database of Minnesota tech companies, an events calendar, a blog 
    aggregator. Would anyone be interested in collaborating with me on 
    something like that?
    
    BTW, I've been checking into the other scripting language users groups in 
    the TC area to try to find people to pimp rails.mn to. Looks like the Ruby 
    group is one of the most active! Only a handful of people attend the Perl 
    and PHP groups. I don't even think there is an active Python group.

    One place where memory can be expensive is virtual hosting. One local ISP
    charges $19/mo if you want 64MB RAM, and $25/mo for 128MB. Every byte
    counts.

    Luke,
    
    Thanks a bunch!  This is definitely in the right direction.   
    According to Nate Schutta, APress has a similar book called "Ajax  
    Patterns and Best Practices" -- both cost the same, seem to offer  
    much of the same, and both are highly rated.  I'm torn, but will pick  
    up one and report back later.

    I was thinking of  doing a session timeout type function for this on the 
    server side.
    
    the session table I am thinking will look something like this
    
    create table sessions (
     id                int        not null auto_increment,
     sessid                varchar(255),
     created_at            datetime    default null,
     updated_at            datetime    default null,
     primary key (id),
     index                 session_index     (sessid)
    );
    
    and then I would check the time that the session was created against the 
    time it was last update and get the difference in hours:minutes. Then I 
    would store this in a table for tracking the accumulated time over a 
    given period for each user.
    
    Capturing duration is solving a requirement that each claimant must meet 
    for a given day week or month. so say there is a req that claimant Dave 
    has to be on the system for 6 hours a day. then I will look at the 
    sessions and the table with other sessions to see if Dave was on the 
    system for 6 hours or not.

    I can't remember who it was that mentioned TextMate during the Rails  
    demo at MinneBar ... but I owe you a tremendous thanks! It's a  
    fantastic editor -- the first one in a very long time I've been  
    willing to fork out money for. So thanks ... whoever that was.
    
    And for those of you on Macs who think modal text editors are not fun  
    and are looking for a good way to edit Ruby -- or HTML, XML, Python,  
    SQL, just about anything else textual -- give it a whirl.
    
    Cheers,
    
    Paul

    I should add that I'm a rank amateur when it comes to anything Rails, so
    don't take anything I say too seriously. I do know a bit about building out
    and supporting production servers, though, and having anything in the DMZ
    able to talk to such a core server as a source repo is generally out of the
    question. I hope this is changed in the future (or that the link I see
    arriving now has a good solution).

    There was a brief mention of DSLs in Ruby by Neal Ford (Thoughtworks) during
    his keynote at No Fluff this last weekend. The talk itself wasn't very
    impressive, but his mention of Ruby as a system for building internal vs
    external DSLs was interesting. Groovy, apparently, is heavily inspired by
    Ruby. One of the talks demoed a DSL style dictionary in Groovy that could
    easily be implemented in Ruby as well. It's good to see that dynamic
    languages are starting to be considered for prime time.

    The rails bundle for textmate is pretty nice too.  Auto-complete
    functionality for the oft-repeated things.

    [Please forward to appropriate lists. -- Luke]
    
    Hi,
    
    MinneBar proved what we suspected all along: the Twin Cities have some 
    kick ass software people doing some kick ass software projects.
    
    To keep the momentum of MinneBar going -- and to give people an 
    opportunity to show off some of their projects -- we're throwing 
    MinneDemo, a DemoCamp for the Twin Cities.  DemoCamps are a sorta light 
    weight, weeknight, demo-focussed mini-BarCamp.
    
    MinneDemo will take place on Tuesday, September 5th @ 6:30pm in 
    Minneapolis at Chiang Mai Thai.  We've reserved their excellent private 
    party room.  We'll have some free/sponsored appetizers and cash bar for 
    drinks.  All are welcome. Details here:
    
     	http://barcamp.org/MinneDemo
    
    We've got time for six 15 minute demos.  Grab a slot if you're interested 
    by editing the MinneDemo wiki page.
    
    It's free food and good company in a fun setting.  Add your name to the 
    MinneDemo wiki page if you can make it.
    
    This'll be the first of hopefully many MinneDemos.  We'll have them 
    quarterly, or maybe even monthly if there's enough interest.
    
    Thanks,
    
    Luke Francl and Dan Grigsby

    Large organizations are much stupider than the sum of their parts,  
    and have an incredible ability to make the simple complex, the fast  
    slow, the reasonable unreasonable.
    
    That, far more than any technology, is the real bane of professional  
    programmers.
    
    My current contract is on a team of 3 (including the manager) in a  
    company of about 15, and it's *amazing* how productive we are. And  
    it's not because of any fancy new technology or methodology we're  
    using -- it's because it's such a tiny organization!
    
    It is super fun to nurture cool new technologies (like Rails) ... but  
    honestly, if we programmers really want to make software development  
    better for everyone, we need to somehow make companies be smaller.
    
    Anyway, right there with you on "Enterprise."

    So like, here's a simple question, yo:
    
    If you were going to write a Ruby-related book for any publisher, which one
    do you think has the most Ruby cred (omitting PragProg for now)? Which pub
    would you most trust?
    
    Damn pubs are coming out of the walls all of a sudden.

    I noticed the ars technica article mentioned that the Java VM was a stack
    machine, which, coincidentally, I'd been reading about the day before (via
    the slashdot link).  After some brief googling, I came across this:
    
    http://www.usenix.com/publications/library/proceedings/vee05/full_papers/p153-yunhe.pdf
    
    
    Which is a nice comparison of register vs. stack architectures for virtual
    machine implementations.

    time logged in is tricky. Most members won't explicitly logout, so  
    you'd need to keep an eye on whether or not the member's browser  
    window was showing your page.
    
    Gmail seems to have some notion of this, as does Blogger's comments  
    window.
    
    What problem does capturing duration solve?

    I think I see why this happened with my inbox:
    
    I had privately written to Bruno suggesting a topic for the next  
    meeting using the same subject line.  I think Apple Mail's "highlight  
    threads" capability overruled the move-to-box rule and put it in my  
    general inbox.  Again, sorry.  So stu-pid.

    O'Reilly and NewRiders come to mind when I think of books I've liked.
    O'Reilly apparently had their first quarter of Ruby books outselling Perl
    recently.

    Thanks.
    
    I did download the graphviz OSX GUI program -- pretty neat.
    
    I actually had played with that awhile back on my OSX (PowerPC) and  
    Graphviz worked fine. I also tried it on my Intel Mac (which has been  
    a very stable machine) -- but when I would open a .dot file -- the  
    whole machine would hang.
    (Very weird).
    
    So - I tried it again today - it looks as if pixelglows graphviz has  
    been fixed or the Mac OS updates fixed the issue -- anyway that .dot  
    viewer now works.
    
    Thanks,
    
    -John

    All:
    
    We've all kinda drank the cool aid with regard to Rails, no?  
    
    I think it's worth having a discussion as to ways Rails doesn't do so well.
    Don't get me wrong: I haven't done a mod_perl or ASP.Net web app since I
    started using Rails, so I'm an enthusiast, but not everything is perfect
    here.
    
    For example:
    
    It's very possibly that I'm just missing parts of the picture, but I keep
    running into Joel's "Law of Leaky Abstractions," particularly with taking
    user input for HABTM style relationships.  
    
    I find that I have these all over the place, and I find that it's hard to
    map the form helpers to the complete data structure, so instead I end up
    using _tag style helpers for the joins and then manually wire them together.
    Hrmph.

    OTUG is decent.  The only one I went to was on JSF (blah blah), which was
    about a year ago, and the next one coming up is on JSF, appropriately just
    about a year later.
    
    Sometimes they'll get really good speakers. I think they had Obie Fernandez
    once, but I brush arms with him once in a while on IRC, so it's not that big
    of a deal. I think they had Martin Fowler or some OO guru once.  For the
    really big guys (like Fowler), expect to pay $20 to see them speak.

    I'm not really concerned whether or not the repository is web- 
    accessible, but I'm assuming that using svnserve will still make it  
    network accessible right?  Also, how does everyone handle the  
    database.yml and development/production setup files when checking out/ 
    committing to subversion?  I prefer to develop on my local machine  
    (I'm lovin' textmate) and will I have to change these files to point  
    to my local machine for every checkin/checkout?

    GMail does this, too. If you send me a message and it's from a RUM
    thread, it ends up in my RUM label and not my INBOX.
    
    I tend to prefix off-list messages with [OFFLIST] in the subject, but
    it doesn't always happen.

    I'd say O'Reilly for its longevity. However, it has probably been 18  
    months since I've spent much time with an O'Reilly book, and I've  
    seen some that were pretty mediocre.
    
    Otherwise, I've had good experience with Sams and Wrox. I would pick  
    those off the shelf over others.

    There's another article about how stack machines are starting to gain
    prevalence in both VMs and real hardware...also on Digg front-page:
    
    http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/media/Eric%20LaForest:%20Next%20Generation%20Stack%20Computing.html
    
    It's interesting to note that although the JVM and the CLR are both stack
    machines, Parrot chose to be a register-based machine.

    Hi Again All,
    
    As you can probably tell I am getting a RoR trial by fire and now I am 
    trying to figure out a system that will track the amount of time a user 
    is logged in for. I am trying to do it so I can look at a user by there 
    id and see how many hours they have been logged in for the day or for a 
    week or even a month. I would like to know the collectives thoughts 
    setting something like this up.

    Oh, and I've gone to the .Net users groups.  The turn out is huge - like 150
    (possible rails.mn prospects) - but nobody talks to one another.  It's kinda
    soulless.

    OTUG is decent.  The only one I went to was on JSF (blah blah), which was
    about a year ago, and the next one coming up is on JSF, appropriately just
    about a year later.
    
    Sometimes they'll get really good speakers. I think they had Obie Fernandez
    once, but I brush arms with him once in a while on IRC, so it's not that big
    of a deal. I think they had Martin Fowler or some OO guru once.  For the
    really big guys (like Fowler), expect to pay $20 to see them speak.

    I'll have one or two for you by the end of summer.
    
     
    
    On a related note, I'd like to know what else is going on around town. What
    does MNteractive do, and how often? Are there other groups around town
    discussing agile development, startups, usability, ajax, etc.?
    
     
    
    Is there a centralized list of tech-related events in Minnesota?

    Hey all,
    
     
    
    Over lunch today, I had a great conversation about our local web app
    properties/projects/etc - or lack thereof.
    
     
    
    I'm not sure if we just don't have a community building cool "web 2.0"
    stuff, or if I'm just not aware of them. I'm thinking it's the later.
    
     
    
    With that in mind, I'm looking for MN-based projects to profile and
    highlight at MNteractive.com (a la TechCrunch.com). 
    
     
    
    The two that come to mind immediately are FlySpy.com and FeedMarker.com.
    What else we got?

    You can locally modify the file for your local box's configuration and 
    Subversion will not overwrite those modifications. Just don't commit the 
    file.
    
    You can also configure Capistrano to dynamically generate the database.yml 
    file when you deploy...then you don't have to check it in at all.

    I don't know if I was clear with this as I was I wanted to be last night.
    in pseudo code, this is what I want to do:
    ActiveRecord::Base::find_by_sql("some sql")
    
    So, I don't want to specify the "class Post < ActiveRecord::Base;
    end;" part since I don't need it..

    I saw the Ajax Patterns and Best Practices, too. Again, I haven't read 
    more than the Table of Contents, but it seems more geared towards 
    programming patterns for Ajax, as opposed to UI patterns:
    
    CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Ajax 1
    CHAPTER 2 The Nuts and Bolts of Ajax 19
    CHAPTER 3 Content Chunking Pattern 53
    CHAPTER 4 Cache Controller Pattern 79
    CHAPTER 5 Permutations Pattern 111
    CHAPTER 6 Decoupled Navigation Pattern 153
    CHAPTER 7 Representation Morphing Pattern 197
    CHAPTER 8 Persistent Communications Pattern 225
    CHAPTER 9 State Navigation Pattern 265
    CHAPTER 10 Infinite Data Pattern 303
    CHAPTER 11 REST-Based Model View Controller Pattern 333
    
    Whereas the O'Reilly book has a lot on UI: 
    http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ajaxdp/toc.html
    
    An aside: It's in O'Reilly's Theory in Practice series, which also has 
    Scott Berkun's nice book The Art of Project Management.

    So this is way OT, but I was digging through the JRuby code.
    
    Is YyTables.java something that was generated or did someone have to
    build that by hand?  I know next to nothing about parsers and
    compilers, and that file scares me.

    Hey All,
    
    Below is what I have decided to do with the tables for the resume. night 
    now I think this is the best solution.
    
    create table job_resumes (
     id                int        not null auto_increment,
     user_id            int        not null,
     resume_title            varchar(255)    not null,
     resume_objective        text        not null,
     constraint fk_resumes_people            foreign key (user_id) 
    references user(id),
     primary key (id)
    );
    
    create table job_histories (
     id                int        not null auto_increment,
     resume_id            int        not null,           
     company_name            varchar(100)    not null,
     postion_title            varchar(100)    not null,
     supervisor_name        varchar(100)    not null,
     supervisor_phone        varchar(100)    not null,
     worked_years            int        null,
     worked_months            int        null,
     starting_wage            decimal(10,2)    not null default 0.0,
     ending_wage            decimal(10,2)    not null default 0.0,
     job_description        text        not null,

     may_contact            int        not null,
     constraint fk_histories_resumes        foreign key (resume_id) 
    references resumes(id),
     primary key (id)
    );
    
    create table job_academics (

     constraint fk_academics_resumes        foreign key (resume_id) 
    references resumes(id),
     primary key (id)
    );
    
    create table job_accreditations (
     id                int        not null auto_increment,
     resume_id            int        not null,

     constraint fk_accreditations_resumes        foreign key (resume_id) 
    references resumes(id),
     primary key (id)
    );
    
    create table job_skills (
     id                int        not null auto_increment,
     resume_id            int        not null,

    Not sure if the latest is in parity with the subversion repos for the
    bundles.  See:
    http://macromates.com/wiki/Main/SubversionCheckout
    Hmm, does your bundle have this feature?
    http://blog.inquirylabs.com/2006/04/21/chaining-snippets-migration-create-co
    lumn-continue/
    
    A subversion checkout will add a bunch of stuff that you don't want (which
    makes TM slow to start syntax highlighting when it first starts) but you
    will be on the bleeding edge.  The main contributor(s) to the Rails bundle
    right now seems to be these guys:
    http://syncpeople.com/downloads/syncpeople_on_rails_features
    That page describes what is "baked in" to TM, I believe

    I'd recommend the latter; on all the Java EE projects I lead we generate 90%
    of our config files from a few simple lists of settings. It makes deploying
    to our 6 staged environments (multi-server clusters, no less) actually
    bearable.

    It turns out my flight is going to be around 1PM on the 12th, so I'm not
    going to be at the hackfest. Hopefully the machine will arrive early enough
    on the 11th that I can get stuff working well.

    BTW, if Jesse, Luke, and Tom go until late (quite possible), we'll
    have to postpone the rest for a future meeting.

    Um, honestly I didn't know how to respond to your post.
    
    I guess I kinda think that web2.0 is a silly fuzzy term but that it  
    serves well as a container for more dynamic application-like web UIs;  
    that the differences between Hotmail and GMail isn't subtle; and that  
    37 signals has been a very loud proponent of a minimalistic  
    applications that aren't shy on AJAX/REST/web2.0/AHAH/call-it-what- 
    you-will and, if the term web2.0 is fuzzy that maybe their work can  
    serve as examples to define the space.
    
    Finally, Luke gave me a point in a direction that looks promising.

    It may have been generated at one point, but it's hand-maintained now. The

    That's all scary, but it means we can (or have to) hand-optimize those other
    pieces. We're also weighing options for alternative parsers, but none seem
    to be significantly faster than our current YACC-based version.

    David,
    I see your point; I got kinda confused when I was writing my reply last
    night. Would it be possible to do the first model but add a resume between
    person ad the others.  So a person can have many skills, etc... As well as
    many resumes?
    
    No sure if this is applicable but you may want to look into polymorphic
    associations (in Edge Rails currently, but coming in 1.1):

    hey,
    
    There was some talk a couple weeks ago about moving the Tuesday
    hackfest to Town Hall this week. Is that still in the cards?
    
    I can bring a boombox to blast some sweet elevator music whilst we
    hack if it would make the change of scenery more palatable.

    Just replying in case someone pulls this thread up in a search.  After
    using it for a month, I have to say that OmniGraffle is awesome.  The
    Pro version has been worth it, simply for the easy creation and
    modification of tables.  The UI is great and the documents look nice
    too.
    
    I wanted to do a quick layout for a web page so I created a stencil
    with basic page widgets, like banner ads, logos, and various other
    "parts" that the page had to contain.  I changed the grid size to use
    pixels, and then was able to move around the parts to get a feel for
    how everything would fit together.
    
    
    Thanks again to everyone who suggested this tool.

    Speaking of which, I've got two questions about my presentation.
    
    1. How long should it be?
    
    2. What's the resolution of the projector? I'd like to make sure my slides 
    look OK.
    
    Also, if I can't find my laptop VGA dongle thingie, will anyone else have 
    a connector?
    
    Thanks,
    Luke

    I bookmarked this, as most of its suggestions are decent.
    
    The author introduces the session storage problem and his SQLSessionStore,
    however, and then writes that

    `Transactions are not required?  Show me this code then, by all means.'
    
    I looked at his code, and it took on the order of two minutes to see that
    it has a race between the web server and purging old sessions.
    
    Like a lot of MySQL users, he doesn't understand how transactions work,
    so his code is broken.
    
    BUT OMG IT"S SO FAST!!!!!11!!1!
    
    And really, what else is there.

    I hear that. Personally, I prefer to avoid that vapid term because it
    implies this distinct division that doesn't exist. The web doesn't have
    releases, and I see these new apps as just showing the increasing maturity
    of development on the web. In my opinion, "web 2.0" is little more than a
    marketing tool similar to how a product might be labeled "new and improved!"
    with nothing new except that label and sometimes even *less* of the quality
    and/or quantity of the original. I've heard that this deception is quite
    popular with cereal, for example.

    Yes, but you already said that. Again, I wonder, how? I just want to know

    are key? Etc. Yeknow.. how? ;)

    Well, this is sorta redundant of me, but I'll add that I don't think the
    term needs that kind of attention. I mean, what benefits do you forsee in a
    clearer definition of this term?

    As I understand the article, it doesn't have direct practical  
    relevance for JRuby. At first I thought, "Huh, they're saying the JVM  
    could be much faster with a different ISA," but then I realized  
    they're explicitly only studying *interpreted* performance. The JVM  
    and CLR both actually compile code, and presumably perform exactly  
    the sort of the stack-to-register translations that they're doing.
    
    Their conclusion might have more relevance for very small devices,  
    however, which interpreter-only VMs.

    Good article there. I agree with it for the most part, but I think it  
    is mostly valid when it comes to third-party code. Using someone else's  
    engine or component will probably not save me time, because I will  
    spend about as much time learning the system and yelling at my computer  
    as I would if I wrote the code myself. But I would only use this  
    internally, and I think it could be valuable for this. (DHH seems to  
    agree at the end of his article.) Is there somewhere that I can drop  
    another app/ directory (complete with views, controllers, models,  
    helpers)? Like /components/killerapp/app/controllers/?

    Trac (http://trac.edgewall.com/) works great if you're already using
    Subversion for your code.  I had some trouble setting it up initially but
    I'm new to this.  YMMV.

    OmniGraffle (OG, heh) does indeed rule.  I always hate reinstalling

    What kind of connector does your laptop have?  The projector can hook
    directly to standard VGA.  I will have VGA => standard DVI and VGA =>
    miniDVI (found on iBooks and 12" powerbooks)

    I find the business world needs terms like Web 2.0. From my  
    experiences - it is terms like Sales Automation, CRM, Web 2.0, Client  
    Server, etc... that people use for creating or justifying projects. I  
    think it is how non-technies summarize a world that is unfamiliar but  
    yet they need to interact with or explain. Sort of similar to  
    mythology - they just need terms to use - even if they are nebulous.  
    Very little independent thought exists in the business world - and if  
    somebody can reuse terms and copy/paste concepts to sell a project  
    internally - they will.
    
    In fact http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/26/ 
    can_anyone_own_web_2.html (found it on the web - so it's true) - web  
    2.0 appears to be coined by O'Reilly -- most likely to help sell  
    conferences.
    
    Article quote:
    "
    O'Reilly has an amazing, wonderful gift for popularizing hard ideas  
    and for explaining abstruse technology in catchy ways. "Web 2.0" is  
    only one of O'Reilly's many accomplishments, which started with the  
    publication of the first user documentation for Unix, and has  
    continued through many iterations of excellent, world-changing ideas  
    and memes.
    
    "
    
    With that being said - I think Web 2.0 is a perfectly acceptable way  
    to describe a collection of "new-thinkings" that is generating lots  
    of projects. It does represent a distinct world (not that I can  
    specifically point to an event or date - but at gun-point I will say  
    Dec 3, last year (and run like hell)) from the previous. And I  
    believe the distinction lies in the idea that people will be spending  
    much more time as a user in some of these new fandagled applications.  
    Also, I feel (it is a gut feeling) that the business world is  
    starting to recognize the benefits of some of this open architecture  
    stuff and rearchitecting with less of a monolithic application  
    strategy. If they call it a web 2.0 project - fine with me.
    
    BTW - I think I will hold out for web 2.0.1 anyway. (Rumor has it  
    they fixed a few gotchas)

    Um, honestly I didn't know how to respond to your post.
    
    Weird. They read like straightforward questions to me.
    
    I guess I kinda think that web2.0 is a silly fuzzy term but that it  
    serves well as a container for more dynamic application-like web UIs;
    
    I hear that. Personally, I prefer to avoid that vapid term because it  
    implies this distinct division that doesn't exist. The web doesn't  
    have releases, and I see these new apps as just showing the  
    increasing maturity of development on the web. In my opinion, "web  
    2.0" is little more than a marketing tool similar to how a product  
    might be labeled "new and improved!" with nothing new except that  
    label and sometimes even *less* of the quality and/or quantity of the  
    original. I've heard that this deception is quite popular with  
    cereal, for example.
    
    that the differences between Hotmail and GMail isn't subtle;
    
    Yes, but you already said that. Again, I wonder, how? I just want to  
    know what differences you think are important, what technical or  
    workflow aspects are key? Etc. Yeknow.. how? ;)
    
    and that 37 signals has been a very loud proponent of a minimalistic  
    applications that aren't shy on AJAX/REST/web2.0/AHAH/call-it-what- 
    you-will and, if the term web2.0 is fuzzy that maybe their work can  
    serve as examples to define the space.
    
    Well, this is sorta redundant of me, but I'll add that I don't think  
    the term needs that kind of attention. I mean, what benefits do you  
    forsee in a clearer definition of this term?

    Yeah, I realized that part way through as well, so their results are fairly
    bogus since the JVM and CLR both compile the stack-based operations to the
    underlying register-based operations anyway (the JVM's JIT and the CLR's AOT
    compilers). I guess the only big lesson out of the paper is that
    implementing register-based interpreters will be faster than stack-based
    interpreters when run on a register-based machine. Duh. Perhaps that's part
    of the motivation behind Parrot, for which I do not believe there is any AOT
    or JIT to underlying machine instructions.
    
    Their conclusion might have more relevance for very small devices, however,

    The other link I posted focuses on stack-based hardware, and how it shows
    promise for many apps. That makes sense in a lot of ways..it's a lot cheaper
    to switch thread contexts for thousands of threads if all you need to do is
    switch a stack pointer register from place to place. The aJile line of
    processors run Java code natively on stack-based hardware, and have a thread
    context switch of something like 10ns. I've used them for an event-driven
    motor driver, where separate threads monitor inputs and feed events to other
    threads that handle switching a motor on and off and signaling the main
    thread of state changes. It was pretty slick.

    Trac is pretty sweet. It's also a wiki and Subversion viewer.
    http://www.edgewall.com/trac/
    
    Bugzilla is the old standby but it shows its age these days.
    
    I've always wanted to try FogBugz as it sounds very easy to use.

    Sorry, I hadn't meant to imply any of this was applicable to JRuby, I just
    found the stack vs. register thing interesting (not having thought about
    it previously).

    Let me know when you're set up, and I'll do the migration when I get  
    a chance.
    
    Speaking of which, I can make the source for the tcrbb site available  
    to anyone
    who'd like to toodle around with it.
    
    The only restriction on the code is to not

    Agree -- Trac.  If it's good enough for the Rails team...
    
    I was able to get it set up pretty easily w/ Apache2 and mod_python -- let

    Ok, we now have a full line-up - thanks to all for the suggestions (if we
    don't get to yours, please remember to suggest it the next time).
    
    We have:
    
    - Chris Carter (the hall-of-famer) presenting a Rails CRM app he's working
    on.
    - Dan Weinand talking about Rails CMSes (Is there a better way to pluralize
    that? Maybe the Inflector knows).
    - Top Brice talking about Rake.
    - An update from Charlie on RailsConf Europe (and European attitudes toward
    Americans)
    
    If there's time, I'd also like to do a little group-refactoring, live and
    unscripted, so bring your nastiest pieces of code for all to ridicule (uh, I
    mean, "constructively criticize").
    
    I'll send out a reminder later in the month, make sure to tell your friends,
    and hope to see you all at Chiang Mai Thai next week (
    http://barcamp.org/MinneDemo).

    The presentations seem to fit our meetings best if they're between
    10-20 minutes and show some code or some system innards if possible.=20
    People tend to ask questions that can stretch it out quite a bit too.

    Sidney,
    Please post a comment or contact the article's author to put this out into
    the cold light of the day.  The author is well-respected in the rails
    community, particularly regarding performance issues, so if there is a
    fundamental flaw (race condition) in his logic please let the community
    know.  There is far too much disinformation out there particularly on this
    topic.
    
    Personally, I get all of my info from respected sources like this.  I know
    that there are many others like me out there.  With all due respect to the
    parties involved, please set 'em straight.
    
    Thanks,
    Tom

    If I were you, I'd think up some cool plant or animal and have O'Reilly
    stencil it for you.   Maybe a plant that symbolizes what Java does for Ruby,
    if there is one, or something dangerous and invasive like eurasian milfoil -
    that would be cool.  And I hope you don't do "JRuby in 21 hours" either, but
    if you do, I'll still buy it.

    Just wondering - has anybody tried any of the high-volume low priced  
    web generation companies?
    
    I was thinking of experimenting by using one of them to lay out a  
    site for a project I have. Then use rails to put the dynamics behind it.
    
    Or - have people found this to be a waste of time - and if so - what  
    would you suggest.
    
    I am looking for good
    css
    html
    javascript
    
    all themed towards a project
    
    I would prefer to be able to create a relationship locally - so if  
    anybody has local companies they just love to work with - please  
    share :)
    
    I have worked with a local company called Little&Company - but they  
    are a bit more towards corporate branding than towards small web  
    projects.
    
    Thanks,
    
    -John

    Hi Tom,
    
    Thanks for the input I was thinking about this for a good chunk of the 
    day. I was thinking the 2nd model was better because each person can 
    have many resumes. The first model seems to limiting this to one resume. 
    Domain Models are no fun especially when there are so many ways to do 
    something. I was thinking about the people table today as well and I 
    might be breaking it up into a more module but possibly less flexible

    So crappy, I can't take anything Joel says seriously.

    Hey All,
    
    	I am sure you all remember my large project that I am working on and  
    I am wondering if any of you would like to do some hourly contract  
    work on it? I have been talking to my client and mentioned that there  
    are some local developers in the area who also work with RoR and  
    Ruby. He seemed to like the idea of bring more people on board as  
    contractors to get it done quicker. If you would be interested in  
    doing this drop me a line and we can talk further about the project.

    In general, one can learn a lot by reading the source code.
    
    And I feel like neither giving that site a bunch of personal info so I
    can post to it nor stalking down his e-mail address, which I don't see
    posted anywhere, just so I can start an argument.
    
    Just tell him I said that a separate session expiry process could delete
    a session between when it is selected and when its access time is updated.

    David,
    I find domain modelling difficult because there is no no "right" way.=20
    I would be interested in other's (more experienced) comments as well.
    
    That said here's the way I see it:
    Your new direction makes sense to me if you do not plan to think of
    these things only in reference to a person.  You limit yourself to
    only see skill when talking about a person's resume.
    
    I would say people have skills, resumes list a person's skills  You
    may have skills (accrediations, etc...) that you may not list on a
    particular resume.
    
    So if you want to be able to "build" several resumes from these things
    a user may have maybe the first domain model is better.
    
    As I said, I'm no expert at this.  I just tried to talk it out.  Anyone els=
    e?
    
    Tom

    Thanks to all for the recommendations.
    
    I've used Trac, and it seems great for a single project. But I may be  
    looking to find a bug tracker that could be used for multiple  
    projects - especially once they are in maintenance. (At any given  
    time, we have about 10 sites that might need bug tracking, and I  
    don't want to have to worry about 10+ Trac sites...)
    
    If I shouldn't be looking for a centralized bug tracking system, I'm  
    open to convincing.

    15 minutes is a little short, but I think that will be a useful  
    constraint. It will require the demoers to cut out all the fluff and  
    only show what is really interesting. Plus, it allows more people to  
    present.

    My friend David Krewinghaus does freelance work for very reasonable rates. 
    I worked with him on the new Amy Klobuchar website. You can check out his 
    portfolio here: http://www.crewinghouse.com/
    
    I'm trying to get him to MinneDemo so he can meet some of the other 
    software developers like me who have no design sense and need a little 
    help.

    Hey guys,
    
    I'm writing to let you know that Minneapolis is getting its own Bar Camp.  
    
    Bar Camp, for those of you not familiar with it, bills itself as "an ad-hoc
    open-conference born from the desire for people to share and learn in an
    open environment."
    
    Open source, rails, AJAX, Web <ahem> 2.0 and the like are common topics for
    discussion.  It's a very participatory event, not a bunch of people half
    sleeping through corporate presenters.
    
    Details here:

    If I wrote a book for O'Reilly I'd choose a liger.  It's pretty much  
    my favorite animal. It's like a lion and a tiger mixed... bred for  
    its skills in magic.  They wouldn't even have to pay someone to draw  
    it:  http://www.liloia.com/images/liger.jpg

    Thanks to all for the recommendations.
    
    I've used Trac, and it seems great for a single project. But I may be  
    looking to find a bug tracker that could be used for multiple  
    projects - especially once they are in maintenance. (At any given  
    time, we have about 10 sites that might need bug tracking, and I  
    don't want to have to worry about 10+ Trac sites...)
    
    If I shouldn't be looking for a centralized bug tracking system, I'm  
    open to convincing.

    Well, that's a good question.  First goal is be able to showcase a  
    goodly number of things -- half a dozen -- without filling a full  
    day.  And since audience will be developers, but not necessarily  
    people with the same backgrounds/platforms/languages, so they needn't  
    be too rich on the implementation details.  It's a showcase for cool  
    things people've accomplished.  It's the ends, not the means to  
    them.  Also, we just borrowed the format from the original DemoCamp  
    since it seems to work.

    Hello all,
    
    I would value your input on a Rails Plugin I've written.
    
    As you all know, one of Rails' conventions is to automatically select  
    the appropriate template to render for an action.  Rails will render  
    the rhtml template named after the action.
    
    This plugin modifies that behavior to choose the default template to  
    render based on the Accept header.  In effect, this plugin takes an  
    action that looks like this:
    
       def my_action
         # some code
       end
    
    And modifies it to behave like this:
    
       def my_action
         # some code
    
         unless performed? # unless something's already been rendered
           respond_to do |format|
             format.html
             format.js
             format.xml
           end
         end
       end
    
    I put this together because I found that, particularly under  
    SimplyRestful, most of my actions had that respond_to block and, in  
    the spirit of not repeating myself, this would be a sensible default  
    behavior.
    
    Broadly speaking, does this make sense?  If it does, does my  
    implementation look reasonable?  If both of these are true then I'll  
    post about this on the Rails list.
    
    Using this plugin with an existing app should be safe because it  
    still defaults to rhtml if there's nothing specific in the headers  
    looking for xml or js.  I'd appreciate it if a few of you would  
    install it with existing applications (on your dev boxes) and confirm  
    that everything still works as expected.
    
    To install it,
    
    	script/plugin install http://www.unpossible.com/misc/ 
    accept_header_to_default_template/
    
    Thanks,
    
    Dan

    Man, if someone could get rights to that drawing the book would sell a
    million copies. It wouldn't even have to be about something interesting.

    Gotta love these one letter method names. Especially when used without any

    If you use separate subversion repositories for each project, Trac can
    handle multiple projects.  For example if you setup
    <Location /svn>
        DAV svn
        SVNParentPath /var/svn
        ...
    </Location>
    to serve mutiple repos you can use:
    TRAC_ENV_PARENT_DIR
    To serve multiple Tracs [1].
    
    I'm currently using this for 4 repositories.  I can show my setup you if you
    want to see how it works.

    Cool. I dig the focus on constraints, but I don't see how it's part of
    increasing participation when we're capping at six presenters.
    
    I'm not trying to just pick on the negative, but I guess I had some
    different ideas about what this might be.
    
    Are we necessarily averse to filling more time in a day? I include our
    regular meetings and any other events in this question. On a few occasions,
    I've thought the monthly meetings were starting to gel and pick up steam
    around the time it starts to get too late. I've casually mentioned weekend
    meetings to a couple people with a lukewarm response.

    I'm trying to install the tcrbb under JRuby and have run into the following
    error, which seems perhaps to be due to a change in MySQL 5.0:
    
    == ListMail: migrating
    ========================================================
    -- create_table(:list_mails)
    rake aborted!
    NativeException: java.sql.SQLException: You have an error in your SQL
    syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for
    the right syntax to use near 'from VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL, to VARCHAR(128)
    NOT NULL, stamp DATETIME NOT NULL, b' at line 1: CREATE TABLE list_mails (id
    int(11) DEFAULT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY, subject VARCHAR(256) NOT
    NULL, replyto VARCHAR(256), from VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL, to VARCHAR(128) NOT
    NULL, stamp DATETIME NOT NULL, body TEXT NOT NULL)
    /home/headius/workspace/jruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/ActiveRecord-JDBC-0.0.1/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/jdbc_adapter.rb:382:in
    `log_no_bench'
    ...
    
    Ignoring the Java bits for the moment, it looks like it 's having a problem
    with the "from". According to this page, you have to explicitly quote
    keywords you want to continue using as identifiers in MySQL 5.0:
    http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/reserved-words.html
    
    So am I doing something wrong here, or what?
    
    The rest of the migrations have run well up to this point (for the first
    time under JRuby!)

    I'm afraid I do not have the experience to come to an informed conclusion on
    my own so I sent an email to the author.  I hope you don't mind me quoting
    you (I omitted the coarse assertion that he does not understand
    transactions).
    
    I'll let you know if/how he replies.

    I've used Jira in the past and it's pretty good: easy to install, use and
    customize and the pricing wasn't bad. You can download and try for yourself.

    15 minutes is a good number because it forces the demo'er into  
    talking about the most important aspects of the of the technology  
    without chance for digression (sorry holden).  Also, the social area  
    is available for deeper analysis if people are interested.

    Hey all!
    
    Unfortunately, due to some big pitches and projects I am involved in  
    at work next week, I won't be able to attend this month's meeting. I  
    would still love to give my presentation on building Jabber bots with  
    XMPP4R, but it'll have to wait until April.
    
    Sorry for the short notice -- I hope everyone has a great time on  
    Tuesday!
    
    
    J.

    Even better, I generally mistake the bug for something else until several
    reports start rolling in from several different machines over the course
    of a couple of weeks, and they don't go away.  Then I start to scratch
    my chin astutely and say, `Hmm, maybe we have a race in here....'
    
    I estimate that thinking these things through up front is 2.7 orders of
    magnitude easier than debugging them later.  Not to mention how grumpy
    the developer who fixes it will be when he finds out he wasted so much
    time on an elementary issue.

    It could just be called "Learing Ligers" and I'd still buy it.

    One thing I don't like about JIRA is that it puts the project name in the 
    bug ID. (Like RAILS-374). It seems like that might make it hard to migrate 
    from one system to a new one.

    Below is Mr (Dr.?) Kaes' response.  Sounds to me like Jonathan is on the
    right track.
    
    Obviously to his credit: a very quick and thoughtful response on the
    subject.  You might also note that he writing a book on the subject [aside
    to Luke: Ah, the rails way ;)]
    
    So whaddya think?

    Trac looks nice. And they get bonus points in my book for supporting  
    PostgreSQL before MySQL. :P
    
    Hmm. It might be a nice alternative to Sourceforge for Macker. (SF's  
    tracker interface brings me no joy.) I wonder if I can point a Trac  
    install on my own server at an svn repository hosted by Sourceforge?

    Nobody ever replied in the affirmative to my query, so I suspect they are not.
    
    I guess I'll be back at dunn bros. next week unless there is still
    interest in scoping out Town Hall.

    Update: One problem that has been rumoured to exist at the moment is  \n\
    that a file might be loaded twice. Behavior resulting from this can  \n\
    be repeated validations, (Model file loaded twice) or stack errors.  \n\
    (File which uses an alias method chain loaded twice.)\n\n\
    If you see this problem, make sure you\x92re not using require and  \n\

    totally independent and do not talk to each other. (But it\x92s on the  \n\
    list.)\n\
    ---\n\n\
    We are having this problem - validation errors show up twice, and we  \n\
    get \"already initialized constant X\" warnings. In fact,  \n\
    \"require_dependency\" doesn't exist at all in our app/, lib/, or test/  \n\
    directories.\n\n\n\

    Lately I've been really happy with the books coming out of Manning and
    Apress.  This isn't a Ruby-specific answer, but it's more toward the
    question of trust.

    Neat promotion.  I'm waiting for them to give me a free house.  Or even 
    better, a small island complete with mad scientist laboratory.
    
    You could write that on the card yourself with a sharpie.  Or on your 
    forehead.

     From what it sounds, the top dogs in the rails team seem to
    regard engines with a jaundiced eye.
    
    That should help you to eliminate #5, as I doubt it will get out of  
    beta.

    Ok, copying the helper to my normal app/helpers dir seems to have it up and
    running. I believe it should be visible under the plugin's app dir though,
    shouldn't it? Or is there some step I missed? Sorry for the n00b
    questions...I'm forcing myself through a crash course in Rails this weekend
    so I don't look like a complete fool at RailsConf.
