%h1='Welcome'

This is the home of Ruby Users of Minnesota &mdash; a fine group of Ruby enthusiasts from around the
Twin Cities metro area (that is to say the fine cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul as well as exotic 
locales like Dinkytown and Pig's Eye.)

%p
  You'll want to 
  =link_to "login", new_session_path
  or
  =link_to "sign up", new_user_path
  to use any of the nifty features, like the
  =link_to "help wanted", :controller=>'opening'
  , 
  =link_to "events", :controller=>'event'
  or 
  =link_to "member list", :controller=>'user', :action=>'list'
  and
  =link_to "for-hire", :controller=>"for_hire"
  sections.
