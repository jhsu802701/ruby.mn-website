%h1='Welcome'

This is the home of Ruby Users of Minnesota &mdash; a fine group of Ruby enthusiasts from around the
Twin Cities metro area (that is to say the fine cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul as well as exotic 
locales like Dinkytown and Pig's Eye.)

%p
  You'll want to 
  =link_to "login", :controller=>'user', :action=>'login'
  or
  =link_to "sign up", :action=>'signup', :controller=>'user'
  to use any of the nifty features, like the
  =link_to "help wanted", :controller=>'opening'
  , 
  =link_to "events", :controller=>'event'
  or 
  =link_to "member list", :controller=>'user', :action=>'list'
  and
  =link_to "for-hire", :controller=>"for_hire"
  sections. 
  %em 
    And if you're a member, you can
    = succeed '.' do 
      =link_to "borrow a book", :controller=>'book'
    That's right, membership does have it's privileges!
